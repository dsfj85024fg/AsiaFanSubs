Former anchor prominent young candidates Korea, Kim Jong Chan.

Plus, there is still a formidable opponent.

49
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,310
No candidate Soon Jae-gu Sinseong party re-elected for the fourth time.

50
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,180
History proves if the ruling party is always far more dominant in terms of number of votes.

51
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,780
Will the election of all 21 this year,

Min Jin.

68
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:48,300
Why can last working for 16 years under the old fart No?

69
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,700
People who have worked with me for 16 years suddenly flip

70
00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:00,440
This is the low standard of our village council members. Beware of people like this, Jong Chan.

71
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,110
Yeonggam-nim, we've heard rumblings if every morning you wake Candidate Kim by phone.

72
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,250
It is true.

73
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,380
Who is this?

74
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,920
It's okay, I use a speaker phone so that others also follow the hearing, Seonbae-nim.

75
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,260

Oh, yes? You said today you will go home tonight?

79
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,870
I have to complete the task of art.

80
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,410
My face!

81
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,140
I work together with Hye Ja.

82
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,620
I know from today Eomma Appa will be very busy.

83
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:49,830
At moments like this I will be more careful.

84
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,030
Write the phone number Hye Ja and paste it into a memo board!

85
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,370

Eomoni, no. No need to prepare anything.

88
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,380
At my birthday, I'd love a hundred million Won, Halmeoni.

89
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,580
Incidentally I've been preparing for a birthday party for him.

90
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,060
You're definitely going to win.

91
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:34,270
During this so finished asking Korea Party candidate, Daesan eleksi always announce the results early.

92
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,870
Because it was here never held any campaign activities.

93
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,540
But there is little change of the circumstances here this year.

94
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,350
Let's examine the eastern region Sinseong-gu Daesan this.

95
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,880
Due to the well-known former anchor Candidate Kim Jong Chan, this area

96
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,020
unexpectedly by many people, getting a lot of attention.

97
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:55,490
In Sinseong-gu is also Member of the Board No Jae Soon of Korea Party previously been successful in several previous elections.

98
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:59,490
Results nomination Korea this time gives new breakthroughs as predicted people.

Public opinion stating that if strategy propaganda campaign launch Candidate Kim Jong Chan was very successful.

 Ms. Min Jin 
Five, four, three, two, one.

116

 Five, four, three, two, one. - Not here. I told you not here.

118

He is not here. There are already more than a year we have not met.

119
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,250
She was with her boyfriend tuh!

120
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,790
Hye Ja? Hye Ja ...

121
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,460
 Ja Hye? Do not know right!

122
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,930
Halo?

123
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,600
Yeobo, there was a bit of a problem.

124
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:55,000
Min Jin until now still not home.

125
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,610
Aigoo ...

126
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,140
Unwrapped turned out to be the wife of a candidate Kim Jong Chan is the Jeolla-do. Why Candidate Kim Jong Chan had to hide his wife's hometown? 

127
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,740
No. Jae Soon on the homepage seems so smug. 
Unwrapped candidate turns out the wife of Kim Jong Chan is the Jeolla-do. Why Candidate Kim Jong Chan had to hide his wife's hometown?

128
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,280
No. Jae Soon on the homepage seems so smug.

129
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,820
If directly to the police now, and his son was home alone,

130
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,820
there is the possibility of causing negative rumors spread.

131
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,090
It could be make headache alone.

132
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:15,160
Min Jin running away from home is also not the first time.

133
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,030
Three months later there is no event like this.

134
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,300
 Due to what will be caused by this controversy, the movements of the two candidates currently in the spotlight masses. 

135
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,000
Women's sexy night club proved to be a single teenage daughter of a parliamentary candidate who is also a well-known former news anchor.

136
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,970
Why, really flirty gorgeous children.

137
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,510
Judging from these photos, is really a very interesting child.

138
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,710
It seems a bit outrageous to call a small child as flirtatious.

139
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,650
Do you hear it?

140
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:41,050
Of course! Which may not? I'm not deaf.

141
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,720
All these are photographs of two years ago.

142
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,990
Do not know why it's time Min Jin quarreled with his friend.

143
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,660
Schoolmate take photos secretly to the complaint to the guidance counselor. It happened too long.

144
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,390
Where can from these photos?

145
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,530
True you from Jeolla-do?

146
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,670
Out err what?

147
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,670
Smile a little, jesu-ssi.
 [Jesu - brother-in-law]

148
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,740
Come out for a while!

149
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,280
Iya tuh! Smile a little.

150
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,280
Promised me ...

151
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,750
... Will not be so again.

152
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,020
But the phone number was wrong numbers Hye Ja.

153
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,290
Hape Min Jin also inactive continue.

154
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,820
After all, you were ...

155
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,430
Why should hide her hometown?

156
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,430
It was like being stabbed in the back.

157
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,560
It was clear out a problem like this is very sensitive.

158
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,570
Who stab you from behind?

159
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,170
Yes you gone mad?

160
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,900
Why do we have to announce it like this before?

161
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,100
What? - What do you want?

162
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,700
Why are you so hot?

163
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,770
Not me hot.

164
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,640
Now this is an odd sounding spiel seonbae.

165
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,440
Hey, fuck you!

166
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,310
All the things that are here,

167
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,580
I'm the one who took the decision.

168
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,320
You bastard!

169
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,250
This campaign is yours what?

170
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,530
I'm also not so sure. But try to be patient Min Jin see how it goes.

171
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:02,060
I'm also not so sure. But try to be patient Min Jin see how it goes.
 Must protect our children.

172
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,000
 Must protect our children.

173
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,870
This is your main strategy. 
Must protect our children.

174
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,870
Wait a day longer.

175
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:12,210
Can not! Time to leave school Min Jin did not bring an umbrella.

176
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,610
If because of this problem we lose, you do not mind?

177
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,280
Child runs away from home will not make you lose.

178
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,350
Seriously do. Do not underestimate Yeonggam.

179
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,280
As soon as she got to know our secret, no one knows what it will do.

180
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,150
Should be considered carefully.

181
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:26,490
True, later also will surely go home alone.

182
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,490
The image of our daughter is also important.

183
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,180
What the heck should worry about?

184
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,120
Party of Korea is not the main target of a political career.

185
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,320
There is a saying of the Jeolla-do.

186
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,590
Although seriously ill until unconscious, the evening still had to be filled with the passion of love.

187
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:11,200
This means that if a child to death, elderly people live to make another one.

188
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,140
Dead child, but parents will not die.

If the news you work with people to get caught, they would be very angry.

192
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,960
Really does nothing?

193
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:45,370
Do not dither! The battlefield must be met with a smile.

194
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:56,440
Forming a new party, you're able to let go of the position as a daepyo?

204
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,340
You ever meet him?

205
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:27,940
He said a good friend?

206
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,080
Never met directly or touch by phone

207
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,550

Not only know if he was a brilliant academic value.

209

Do not know her. Do not know who this person is.

214
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,630
 The wife of Kim Jong Chan candidate of the Party of Korea Uncovered came from Jeolla-do. Father-in-law came from Jeolla-do and the Gwangju civil servants. Kim Jong Chan deliberately hide this fact.

215

Everything is not a good girl.

218
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,780
Perhaps this data can help you.

219
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:24,400
Hit and run incident last night but there was no other incident.

00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,800
I do not understand art, Yeobo.

239
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,540
If so, try Hye Ja says that's who.

240

Yesterday Min Jin also no art classes.

245
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:14,110
Yeah, Min Jin no art class yesterday.

246
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,980
Signal HAPE Min Jin

Hours segitu was no art class.

250
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,460
Possible hapenya exhausted betere also very high.

251
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,590
He is Choi Mi Ok.

252
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:35,330
Yesterday Min Jin and Choi Mi Ok was in school until the evening.

253
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,730
Because he does not bring an umbrella.

254
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:57,620
Choi Mi Ok (16)

255
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,360
Yesterday I and Min Jin long been at the new school home.

256
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,430
From behind heard no engine noise car, so I'm turning my head and see.

257
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:11,900
He left on the car. White sedan.

258
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:16,300
Do not lie! Not maybe my son carelessly climbed into a stranger.

259
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,310
It looks like the two of them know each other.

260
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,310
Boys or girls?

261
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:24,450
It looks like the guy, but what I like girls too huh?

262
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:28,180
I do not remember the license plate number.

263
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,720
All CCTV in the area around it has been checked.

264
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,590
But there was nothing.

265
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,330
What does your father do?

266
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,460
A driver.

267
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,530
Trucks taIk. One truck contents taIk all.

268
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:48,200
It's called sludge trucks.

269
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,740
Continue your mother?

270
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,080
Do not have a mother, their stepmother.

271
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,080
A family of three of them live at home?

272
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,080
Halmeoni also exist. Her health condition is very bad.

273
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,420
Continue to have two younger sisters and two younger brothers.

274
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,020
Can think of where this?

275
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,690
You know what this stuff?

276
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,830
Watch.

277
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,560
Your father brought the truck fecal feed 8 people,

278
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,300
You say this is yours?

279
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,700
This is a man to his father Min Jin.

280
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,240
Used by Min Jin after he replaced his watch strap.

281
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,910
She said after moving here stolen.

282
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,980
Because the price is very expensive, I did not dare to tell the police and you say this is yours?

283
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,840
Damn! This is mine!

284
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,380
 Search for a missing child 

285
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,120
 Wanted missing children 
Choi Mi Ok? Schoolgirl Choi Mi Ok?

286
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,190
 Search for a missing child 

287
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,520
Mau was a cop or a reporter,

288
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,320
Want the police or reporters
 Kim Chang Hoon (32) 

289
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,460
a student asked me about that one.
 Kim Chang Hoon (32) 

290
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:45,590
Kim Chang Hoon (32) 

291
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,530
Because I was homeroom Min Jin.
Kim Chang Hoon (32) 

292
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,130
Because I was homeroom Min Jin.

293
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,930
Yes, true.

294
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,330
Last year I had become homeroom Choi Mi Ok.

295
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:56,140
Last year I had become homeroom Choi Mi Ok.
 Eom Ok Ran (41) 

296
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:56,270
Last year I had become homeroom Choi Mi Ok.

297
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,010
But just now the police have a check.

298
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,750
Student academic achievement is quite remarkable.

299
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,020
Can be considered stable.

300
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,560
Min Jin Mi Ok and two students have had a close relationship.

301
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,890
First grade they had been classmates.

302
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:27,640
But Seonsaeng-nim, you're obviously lying.

303
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,840
You said a stable academic grades are not up and down.

304
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,840
It is clearly up and down.

305
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,850
There is no evidence that if the boy had stolen a watch Min Jin.

306
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:43,380
Tell the police could so carelessly will involve many people.

307
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:48,190
Silence, the child will not be back.

308
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,530
How good is it?

309
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:57,800
I know in a situation like this will seem a bit silly I said like this.

310
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:02,340
You remember in high school we've made arrangements regarding the dream of the future?

311
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:08,740
Sure, you say you want to be like Hillary (Clinton) to be a mother country.

312
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,950
If I either gone mad or anything, I said I wanted to be a wife and a good mother.

313
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:20,760
Yeon Hong us at that time pretty incredible.

314
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:27,030
By the way, where Min Jin is?

315
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,440
Already, halo?

316
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,840
Have arrived.

317
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,840
I am from the Crime Unit.

318
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,910
- In the future both cases the loss of your daughter will be handled by me. - Let's talk in the car alone.

319
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:57,860
The loss of your daughter are both first noticed by Samunim.

320
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,860
Really.

321
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,400
That day is the first day of the campaign.

322
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,070
What is the reason Candidate Kim continue to participate in campaigning even though her daughter is missing?

323
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:12,140
The level of support obtained should be getting dropped, is not it?

324
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,880
You expect me to not participate in the election?

325
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,950
No, it's just that there is a bit of a question mark.

326
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,080
There was a smell of feces, needed fresh air.

327
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,620
By the time your daughter is gone, what are you doing?

328
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,560
What did you say?

329
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,830
By the time your daughter is gone, what are you doing?

330
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,230
At that time there was a very important meeting.

331
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,630
Who are the participants of the meeting?

332
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,700
It can not be kukomentari for political reasons.

333
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,370
Just tell them, Yeobo.

334
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:51,510
Later in time if it is necessary, just let me tell you.

335
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:19,410
Remembering all the times where you rebelled and was determined to become a singer.

336
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:23,140
About genes inherited by the daughter who we are? Every day make him just a storm in the outdoor.

337
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,280
Of course he is hiding where.

338
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,220
Just lost your daughter could not be found.

339
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:36,090
That day you were drinking with anyone until late so?

340
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,640
Important is this issue?

341
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,050
This is a serious problem.

342
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,790
How important?

343
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,130
This issue relates to the decision to live with you,

344
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,990
or enough to stay here.

345
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:17,330
What?

346
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:20,800
If anything happens to themselves Min Jin,

347
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,470
what would you do?

348
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,420
Our daughter is missing!

349
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,950
As a father the whole brain just met how to win in the election!

350
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:41,360
As this son can have the desire to go home?

351
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,640
The people I meet are the ones who can you trust.

352
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:11,250
The way you like it before you want me to say?

353
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,820
 Love being able to serve you. How may I help you? 

354
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,290

After seeing this maybe you will understand.

382
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:36,320
The audience does not look very enthusiastic about their stage performance.

383
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:46,330
It looks like you did not know.

384
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:51,270
Min Jin ostracized by her friends.

385
00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:00,470

When doing this, it could be I have to take off my uniform.

408
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,230
By doing so, Kim candidate makes no difference to have violated the law.

409
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:36,440
You will give voice to the No. Jae Soon, right?

410
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,980

Inhale deeply and then exhale slowly.

416
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:15,140
It was blinding. Pull another deep breath.

417
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:33,030
There was parked a white sedan car.

418
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:41,700

00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:51,310

420
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:55,450

428
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:34,150
The car was speeding past me.

429
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:40,960
Instead, the car drove by slowly.

430
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,230
Drove very slowly.

431
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:51,510

439
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,220
Did not you say he was going to Seoul to become a singer?

440
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,290
Indeed there I say so?

441

Maaf, Samunim.

476
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,070
Last time I want to ask.

477
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:42,270
That night ...

478
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:46,010
Jin Min's father met with whom you did not know?

479
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:49,340
Iya, aku sama sekali tidak tahu Samunim.

00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,220
Bring investigative data Min Jin me!

481
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:04,820
If you've betrayed and defected No Jae Soon here,

482
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:09,900
at least you have to prove to us if you are the one who can we trust.

483
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:13,900
Do not just want riches to live your life.

484
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:24,310
Yes Secretary General, I will be watching Samunim well. Do not worry.

485
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:30,180
Study examine carefully ... carefully. Keep your brain in order to keep a clear head.

486
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:33,790
Examine carefully ... think carefully.

487
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:36,190
Keep your brain in order to keep a clear head. Examine carefully.

488
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:43,260
The review more closely starting from scratch.

489
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:47,270
That day is the first day of my husband's campaign.

490
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:50,600
I also campaign issue due to busy, no time for anything else.

491
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:55,410
I made my daughter eat kimbap. Is she eating properly?

492
00:36:56,210 --> 00:37:00,750
Oh yes, that day ... that day ...

493
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:05,950
I heard that song often sung by Min Jin.

494

495
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,570
Then 11.

496
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:36,780
Do you have any evidence if the day was No. Jae Soon whistling in front of you?

497
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:40,250
Moreover, you have proof if the song is a love song sung Min Jin?

498
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:05,750
We tapped! I suspected as No. Jae Soon Gregg's ...

499
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:09,080
That's why he could know the song often sung Min Jin.

500
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:18,420
Pick up all the equipment we have in No. Jae Soon and replace it with this.

501
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:30,570
 Immediately remove from office Yeonggam.

00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:11,140

506
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,010

508
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,020
 Candidate Kim Jong Chan, step back! 
To be able to get sympathy from supporters who already disappointed

509
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:17,820
 Candidate Kim Jong Chan, step back!
Seems to be a very difficult mission.

510
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,020
seems to be a very difficult mission.

511
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:21,690

00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,900
As a mother, so incompetent.

00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:36,100
Still dare rear its head?

519
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:40,240
Please save my daughter ... Please save my daughter.

Moon Wiwonjang personally attended the funeral.

529
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:21,730
Public Opinion sure if this is a form of support for the candidate Kim Jong Chan to finish the campaign program.

530
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:25,470
Why can happen something like this?

531
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:28,410
Kim Min Jin lost on the day of the commencement of the campaign

532
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:30,140
eventually returned to the side of his parents in a state of motionless.

533
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,950
Discordant voices that had been cornered Candidate Kim Jong Chan

534
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:35,880
slowly turned into sympathy and support.

535
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,280
Jin Min's death had saved his father.

536
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,750
At this time all the people mourn the departure of Min Jin.

537
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:04,440
Bunyi bel berdenting ting ting ting ting ting.

538
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:10,980
End of the skirt revealed ... a mad woman going carrying garlands. Get out!

539
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:18,720
10240 ... small meteor falling from the sky in green ...

540
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:26,470
The hole filled with darkness. The place where you were not illuminated by sunlight. Only darkness.

541
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:37,010
- Gila!
- Yeobo! Yeobo!

542
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:43,950
At that time I felt no matter what I say,

543
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:46,490
you will never forgive me.

544
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:52,090
Actually, today it is Sin Seon Mi Board Member of Sejong party.

545
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,630
I know.

546
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:59,030
Surely while drinking alcohol thrash out great promise in the future.

547
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:01,570
We are already over.

548
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,910
Yeobo ...

549
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:13,310
Do not tell me over.

550
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:16,520
We are already over.

551
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:21,320
You and I can not be over just like that.

552
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,120
We are already over.

553
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:27,330
Want it atupun electoral politics, had no meaning anymore.

554
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:31,600
You! Who killed my son.

555
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:35,870
Please ... please so you calm down and think again.

556
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:40,270
Settle down and think again?

557
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:41,870
Honestly, I believe it may be

558
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:46,150
Secretary General to have the sympathy of the people and killed my daughter.

559
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:49,880
Or you can for the sake of winning this election

560
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,550
paying people to kill my daughter.

561
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:58,290
Under the covers, anyone can not be trusted.

562
00:44:58,290 --> 00:44:59,760
The brains of people who are here there is only political.

563
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,300
Points depraved morals!

564
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,630
Enya!

565
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:27,520
Have you forgotten? Have you forgotten what ever you say?

566
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:47,940
My daughter really died for me.

567
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,940
So I have nothing, Yeobo?

568
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,310
10240.

569
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:21,570
10240... 10240...

570
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,580
10240...

571
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:30,780
10240... 10240...

572
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:34,790
Bunyi bel berdenting ting ting ting ting ting.

573
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:37,190
End of the skirt revealed ... a crazy woman ...

575
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:43,730
Small meteors falling from the sky in green ...

576
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:46,400
The hole filled with darkness.

577
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:54,670
The place where you were not illuminated by sunlight. Only darkness.

578
00:46:54,940 --> 00:47:01,750
No smell of cigarettes on you. You are my food, cemilanku, my soul.

579
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:04,680
10240.

580
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:15,230
You can correct the overall winner?

581
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:20,030
Min Jin academic value every time there must be progress.

582
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:23,500
Although it feels strange, but I want to believe it.

583
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:30,310
The sound of the bell tinkled .. Ting, ting, ting, ting, ting. 

584
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:36,320
 Fringe skirt revealed .. crazy woman came out carrying flowers. Get out! 

585
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:36,980
Enyah! 

586
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:44,060
 Small meteor falling from the sky is green ..

587
00:47:44,060 --> 00:48:03,810
The hole filled with darkness. The place where you were not illuminated by sunlight. Only darkness. 

588
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:09,150
10240.. 

589
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:12,890
Seonsaeng-nim, what your email?

590
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:16,090
There is something I want to send it to you.

591
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:17,560
I'm a little busy right now.

592
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,290
Soon should I call?

593
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:30,500
This is my email account.

594
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,640
Choi Mi Ok is suspect?

595
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:45,180
In the evenings where Min Jin missing,

596
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:51,590
there are witnesses who saw Mi Ok passing with bodies covered in blood.

597
00:48:54,660 --> 00:49:02,130
Eomonim, certainly Mi Ok maybe not do that.

598
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:11,880
SMS was already entered. Thanks, Seonsaeng-nim.

599
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:15,880
Even if you did not commit.

600
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,950
But if it was not you who killed,

601
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:22,960
why is there blood in the sports shoe yours?

602
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,430
Why do not you see! No visible black spots this?

603
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:28,560
It is the blood of Min Jin, Jin Min blood.

604
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,100
DNA test results show this is the blood of Min Jin.

605
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:34,570
That's why I suggested a not lie.

606
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:38,970
Before once me and Min Jin moving goods.

607
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:41,110
At that time there was a taxi ran a red light and drove toward us.

608
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:43,510
I encourage Min Jin like this.

609
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:46,450
Min Jin fell and scraped her knee.

610
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:49,110
Blood stains on the sports shoe is derived from that day.

611
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:52,590
Eomoni!

612
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:55,650
Skirt school uniform belonged to Min Jin!

613
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:57,520
So short, his butt almost invisible.

614
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,190
You said scraped knee injury. You think I can not know if there are things like this?

615
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:01,130
You do not lie!

616
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:03,000
It is true that there are abrasions on knees Min Jin.

617
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,730
But the wounding of when, not yet certain.

618
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:06,200
Therefore, calm yourself first.

619
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:08,200
When to scratch?

620
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,600
Eomonim!

621
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:14,610
My daughter is not the culprit.

622
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:16,480
Help out first!

623
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:21,280
Driver Choi ... is her father?

624
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:27,820
What is this? From the beginning you already know?

625
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:29,820
Out .. out first.

626
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:33,030
Your daughter ... my husband called feces.

627
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:38,100
He said the car driven by his father, was filled with feces!

628
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:40,100
Son, why talk like that?

629
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:42,500
It is definitely time at home driver Choi talk like that.

630
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,640
So much hate you to my husband?

631
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,840
My daughter!

632
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,370
not an ordinary child talk like that. - Come out first.

633
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,650
I did not teach him anything. Also very excellent academic value.

634
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:54,650
It's a very good boy.

635
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:56,920
The daughter of a truck driver faeces which may be a good academic grades?

636
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,850
Two years ago your daughter

637
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:04,120
academic grades are not the result of his hard work.

638
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,720
Ask yourself on your daughter.

639
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:08,660
- What happened exactly? - Detective Lee.

640
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:10,800
If you've finished, please go.

641
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:16,140
As a father, at least the child's academic progress note. A little strange, is not it?

642
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:18,400
You're fired!

643
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,550
Asshole!

644
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:27,750
Stop!

645
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:32,020
According to rumors, residence and work space Candidate Kim Jong Chan tapped illegally,

646
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:34,820
on the instructions of Candidates No. Jae Soon.

647
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:36,690
Here is the response from independent candidate No. Jae Soon.

648
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:38,290
Kandidat Kim Jong Chan...

649
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:42,030
use the cases of illegal tapping is still not certain truth

650
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:45,500
I accidentally scapegoat in the middle of the campaign.

651
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,640
I assure you that by using my political career, I would have to uncover the truth.

652
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:03,250
After the death of Min Jin

653
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:06,050
my husband's position in this election is very advantageous.

654
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:07,650
Secretary General...

655
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:11,390
managed to help me get the investigation report the case of Min Jin.

656
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:41,290
There was a child dressed in the uniform of there

657
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:44,490
walk here without opening the umbrella.

658
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:47,160
Like the ghost of a woman.

659
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:51,030
I got to thinking the rain was so heavy why he was so.

660
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:54,630
It turns out the boy's entire body was covered in blood.

661
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:57,440
Body also filled with mud.

662
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:02,910
Then I asked him why not come home even in the rain.

663
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:05,580
Why not go home even in the rain?

664
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:19,590
But the boy ran away.

665
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:28,530
But, it was raining too hard,

666
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:35,070
plus the sky was dark. The boy was the establishment far away from me.

667
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:40,680
So, the child is a child who was ...

668
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:44,680
or not the child who was ...

669
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:50,290
It seems not.

670
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:54,290
No, he's not Mi Ok.

671
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:56,300
- Not. - Interrogation ended.

672
00:53:56,300 --> 00:54:00,170
On the uniform Choi Mi Ok, there were no blood stains.

673
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:03,240
What color is this?

674
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,170
Trying to give a different answer to his conscience.

675
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:07,770
Green color.

676
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:15,250
Well, starting now yes.

677
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:19,250
Your father is a driver's father Min Jin,

678
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:20,850
hurt your pride?

679
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,120
No.

680
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,670
You ... bury Min Jin?

681
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:38,070
No.

682
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:44,080
Why hapemu reformatted?

683
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,750
Anyone want you hiding?

684
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:52,080
Today it is exposed to rain so problematic.

685
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,350
Just answer with a 'yes' or 'no'.

686
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:57,020
Because it was reformatted.

687
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:10,240
Min Jin did you kill?

688
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:16,640
No.

689
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:23,850
Min Jin ...

690
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:26,520
was the son of the hated person.

691
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:34,930
When her father came to school to become a teacher one day

692
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:38,530
friends the other must also have the same feelings.

693
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:40,800
His father ya?

694
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Ajussi how your income?

695
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,140
There is as much as my father?

696
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,480
I understand your feeling.

697
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:57,480
This is our secret. I promise.

698
00:55:57,750 --> 00:56:01,620
Why? You're not willing to work as an anchor woman?

699
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:04,160
If you want to become an anchor woman, what should I do?

700
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:06,560
Sorry.

701
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:10,300
Because I had spent some time in Washington joined my father.

702
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:12,970
You mad?

703
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:16,840
Do not be angry.

704
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:26,450
Enyah!

705
00:57:15,830 --> 00:57:18,500
 Gab: The job has been completed correctly? When will the new picture given? 10:27 Morning 3:20.

706
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:24,370
Really dumb.

707
00:59:55,850 --> 00:59:57,320
Can not die.

708
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:59,860
At the hospital feeling quite ugly.

709
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:04,660
It may be that later had to receive psychiatric treatment.

710
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:24,150
Wah! Do you like the songs of Joan Faye ya?

711
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:30,560
Joan Faye!

712
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,490
Joan Faye!

713
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:35,760
Joan Faye!

714
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:40,970
Name the song Wild Rose Hill, okay?

715
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:48,710
Want to teach you a way that is really effective?

716
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:04,590
Really effective way is to jump down from the top.

717
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:13,130
Scorching hot.

718
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:45,220
Note Investigating Murders Candidates daughter Kim Jong Chan.

719
01:03:24,730 --> 01:03:26,600
In the email account for my daughter

720
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,600
mail more than five thousand.

721
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:32,070
From among that I find the mail received about 2 years ago.

722
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,740
The first semester of the class before the final exam.

723
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:36,880
Emails received three days earlier.

724
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:41,150
Take a look here, 10240 send exam questions.

725
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:44,220
Fill the empty mail.

726
01:03:45,550 --> 01:03:47,020
Lest already sent repeatedly.

727
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:49,690
Because the content is lost, so resubmitted again.

728
01:03:49,690 --> 01:03:52,760
So my daughter could not remove it.

729
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:03,030
This is a report card that grades my daughter ever before.

730
01:04:06,770 --> 01:04:08,110
Take a look here!

731
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:10,240
Starting from the first semester final exam grade one,

732
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,510
value suddenly becomes nice all.

733
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:15,050
Similarly, Choi Mi Ok.

734
01:04:15,050 --> 01:04:17,450
During that period it ranked second child suddenly developed.

735
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:21,050
After that stable continues to be in the top ranking.

736
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:24,260
But Choi Mi Ok now one of the suspects.

737
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:26,930
You do not feel anything strange?

738
01:04:28,930 --> 01:04:30,400
It is not clear also.

739
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:34,130
If the rank down about 30 rank is likely to be a problem.

740
01:04:34,530 --> 01:04:38,270
But instead, most people will not feel if this was odd.

741
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:42,270
My daughter it made no difference to me.

742
01:04:42,270 --> 01:04:45,080
No talent in the field of learning.

743
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:49,750
Really?

744
01:04:50,010 --> 01:04:54,550
Lest you have a suspicion if the death of Min Jin nothing to do with this.

745
01:04:54,550 --> 01:04:57,620
What's your excuse leaked exam questions to my daughter?

746
01:04:57,620 --> 01:05:00,430
I leaked it because I like it.

747
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:02,830
Because of that my daughter was murdered?

748
01:05:02,830 --> 01:05:04,560
Yes you crazy?

749
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,300
Why should I kill him?

750
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:14,040
I really ... really like Min Jin.

751
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:19,910
If you like it rightly guided him to choose the right path.

752
01:05:19,910 --> 01:05:21,250
Why even give the exam?

753
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:24,050
Because he wants so.

754
01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:26,320
I only gave exam questions.

755
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:28,850
The answers to the questions that everything he's working on his own.

756
01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:32,320
Eomoni probably do not know.

757
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:37,000
Min Jin much smarter than people expected.

758
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:56,750
If handed over to the police for investigation,

759
01:05:56,750 --> 01:06:00,080
Ji Min for the deceased will only embarrass him alone.

760
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:16,370
In this election, you can also expect to win, right?

761
01:06:19,170 --> 01:06:21,970
Min Jin in school are often ostracized.

762
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:25,580
After he died, they also have to be tortured by various rumors, so?

763
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:37,320
Hit and run incident last night but there was no other incident.

764
01:06:39,590 --> 01:06:41,860
Where the scene?

765
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:45,730
On the outside of the roundabout near the U-Town.

766
01:06:45,730 --> 01:06:49,470
Involved was a man. After all he is a newcomer.

767
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:45,260
Do not move! If moving the wound gets worse.

768
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:31,300
Reported if the main actors persecutor wife Candidates from the party Kim Jong Chan Korea

769
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,440
No candidate is a staunch advocate Jae Soon,

770
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:37,040
volunteers cleaning the city, Kim XX.

771
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:41,050
Kim XX previously known to have posted more than 20 articles on the homepage Candidates No. Jae Soon

772
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:44,920
which vilify princess Candidate Kim Jong Chan and his wife's hometown.

773
01:08:59,730 --> 01:09:01,060
Samunim sudah sadarkan diri.

774
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:08,940
You assign the Secretary General to send people to watch me, right?

775
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:18,550
I'm afraid if something happens to you.

776
01:09:29,630 --> 01:09:34,970
This is the latest models.

777
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:36,970
You should always take it as well.

778
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:42,040
Also took out the manuals.

779
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:59,390
Do not get hurt, Yeobo.

780
01:10:00,190 --> 01:10:05,000
Min Jin also would expect if you were okay.

781
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:27,020
Thanks, Yeobo.

782
01:10:36,490 --> 01:10:49,570
Yeobo, our daughter may not be as good as we think.

783
01:10:49,970 --> 01:10:59,050
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

784
01:10:59,050 --> 01:11:02,520
There are still 11 and a half.

785
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:07,190
Now, our party will begin.

786
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:10,130
Leisure time in October.

787
01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:13,730
Our future will always be together ...

788
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:16,930
The darkness of night had arrived.

789
01:11:16,930 --> 01:11:20,540
Times where the stars will be shining brightly.

790
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:25,740
Syulu lu lu lu lu ... penggal kepalaku.

791
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:31,350
Syulu lu lu lu lu ... merangkul erat hatiku.

792
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:35,490
It's time to leave, to the Wild Rose Hill.

793
01:11:35,490 --> 01:11:41,490
Syulu lu lu lu lu ... Tempat di mana kupu-kupu terbang menuju langit.

794
01:11:41,890 --> 01:11:47,230
Yulu lu lu lu lu ... Bless me so that my dream turned into reality.

795
01:11:47,630 --> 01:11:51,900
It's time to leave, to the Wild Rose Hill.

796
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:07,120
This really is me.

797
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:11,260
Beginning so fans because they watch the show.

798
01:12:12,190 --> 01:12:13,390
Why?

799
01:12:13,660 --> 01:12:17,130
The lyrics of their songs that really tell my story.

800
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:23,130
Want video I show Ok Jin and the others?

801
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:30,880
It is my record.

802
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:38,750
It certainly Mi Ok would never do anything like that at Min Jin.

803
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:43,820
Ok adalah orang yang terkeren pernah to jumpai.

804
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:46,490
We were very happy.

805
01:12:46,490 --> 01:12:52,630
Min Jin was very worried when after his victory in the election he will study abroad and Mi Ok alone would be ostracized here.

806
01:12:52,930 --> 01:12:56,370
If you do not want to be isolated, academic achievement has to be bright

807
01:12:56,370 --> 01:12:58,240
Ways must also be fashionable dress.

808
01:12:58,370 --> 01:13:01,440
Mi Ok family is really poor.

809
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:11,180
Choi Mi Ok...

810
01:13:13,450 --> 01:13:14,750
For So Yeon.

811
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:19,460
So Yeon Cho, his style that you like wearing uniforms that are too small like this?

812
01:13:21,990 --> 01:13:24,230
Wild Rose Hill

813
01:13:24,260 --> 01:13:29,730
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. 

814
01:13:29,730 --> 01:13:32,140
 Still there are 11 and a half.

815
01:13:32,140 --> 01:13:37,480
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. 

816
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:39,880
Still there are 11 and a half. 

817
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:45,620
 Now, our party will begin.

818
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:50,020
 Free time in October. 

819
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:51,890
 We are the future will always be together ..

820
01:13:51,890 --> 01:13:58,300
 The heart that is being bemoaned. 

821
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:02,830
Later will not be deterred in the least.

822
01:14:02,830 --> 01:14:08,840
Syulu lu lu lu lu ... merangkul erat hatiku.

823
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:10,840
 Embracing close to my heart. 

824
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:16,450
Syulu lu lu lu lu ... penggal kepalaku.

825
01:14:16,450 --> 01:14:18,450
 Term head. 

826
01:14:18,450 --> 01:14:24,320
Lu lu lu lu Yulu ... Bless me so that my dream turned into reality.

827
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:26,460
 Bless me so that my dream turned into reality. 

828
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:02,290
Leisure time in October.

829
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:07,220
What you mean is the first day of campaigning dad, right?

830
01:16:07,630 --> 01:16:10,430
The day was very busy father and mother.

831
01:16:15,370 --> 01:16:18,300
Wild Rose Hill is a hill canker.

832
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:22,170
What is meant by 11 and a half is ...

833
01:16:22,170 --> 01:16:25,380
Tonight at 11:30, right?

834
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:28,580
One hundred million stars is what?

835
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:31,120
Money?

836
01:16:32,850 --> 01:16:36,720
Because Min Jin never ask for 100 million as a birthday gift.

837
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:51,000
You are preparing for a party, is not it?

838
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,270
What party is it?

839
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:56,740
The intended party is ...

840
01:16:56,740 --> 01:17:00,080
Prepare money for the person who leaked exam questions to you.

841
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:02,880
I knew who it was.

842
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:12,360
Min Jin wrote the lyrics I compose the melody.

843
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:16,090
We will never plagiarized a song written by someone else.

844
01:17:17,030 --> 01:17:18,500
This is your shirt.

845
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:20,630
Yesterday I met Cho So Yeon.

846
01:17:20,630 --> 01:17:23,170
He was wearing clothes.

847
01:17:23,170 --> 01:17:25,040
You may have already washed many times.

848
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,040
But once checked, will be caught.

849
01:17:30,770 --> 01:17:33,180
My mother has passed away. I only have a father.

850
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:34,650
But the father is married to the new mother.

851
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:36,380
Endlessly birth siblings.

852
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:37,980
At my side there is only Min Jin.

853
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:40,120
Why should I kill him? Why?

854
01:17:41,450 --> 01:17:43,990
Okay, you did not commit.

855
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:45,460
And who on earth

856
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:48,390
Min Jin who killed it?

857
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,670
That girl.

858
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:58,540
The woman hired someone to kill Min Jin.

859
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:00,140
This is a killer phone belongs Min Jin.

860
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:01,870
This is a killer phone belongs Min Jin. 
 Problem have you clean up? When are you going to send me a picture? 

861
01:18:01,870 --> 01:18:03,740
Take a look here, his name is Gab. 
 Problem have you clean up? When are you going to send me a picture?

862
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:04,140
Take a look here, his name is Gab.

863
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:06,410
There continues to be a phone number of the mastermind.

864
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:14,420
Min Jin died because of me.

865
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:18,020
Because of the money that was willing to be given to me.

866
01:18:18,820 --> 01:18:20,820
Due to a poor family.

867
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:23,630
And Min Jin will study abroad.

868
01:18:28,030 --> 01:18:30,830
I brought the damn car.

869
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:34,570
By the time he was off guard.

870
01:18:34,570 --> 01:18:39,110
As did the bastard of Min Jin, I'm over it.

871
01:18:39,110 --> 01:18:42,180
I've learned from my father's driving.

872
01:18:42,580 --> 01:18:45,520
Back and forth back and forth.

873
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,000
One time...

874
01:18:48,270 --> 01:18:50,370
Twice...

875
01:18:50,850 --> 01:18:52,590
Three times...

876
01:20:58,050 --> 01:20:59,920
Addressed to the President.

877
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:04,590
After Min Jin die, I do not know when I will die.

878
01:21:04,590 --> 01:21:07,260
That's why I'm writing a will.

879
01:21:07,660 --> 01:21:09,390
Mr. President ...

880
01:21:09,790 --> 01:21:12,330
Perpetrators of the murder of Min Jin and I

881
01:21:12,330 --> 01:21:16,330
is the Son So Ra-nim Seonsaeng Princess Sinseong junior high school teacher.

882
01:21:16,730 --> 01:21:19,540
The reason Son So Ra killing us is

883
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:25,680
because in our hands there is a video she made love with a man.

884
01:21:26,610 --> 01:21:36,220
Last year we gave an air deodorizer that is equipped with a hidden camera in the Son So Ra and secretly recording the video.

885
01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:39,420
Because the woman was

886
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:43,290
during these two years to help us steal the exam questions.

887
01:21:44,230 --> 01:21:47,160
Finally, after we extort money from her 100 million

888
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:50,630
She hired people to kill Min Jin.

889
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:55,040
Dear Mr. President,

890
01:21:55,170 --> 01:21:58,780
please drop the death penalty in Son Seonsaeng So Ra-nim.

891
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:02,380
It is our hope the last.

892
01:22:03,050 --> 01:22:05,180
May you always in good health.

893
01:22:06,650 --> 01:22:08,520
Signed, Choi Mi Ok.

894
01:22:17,060 --> 01:22:18,930

895
01:22:18,930 --> 01:22:20,130
No!

896
01:22:20,530 --> 01:22:22,400
No, give it back to me!

897
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:24,940
I'm not yet senile.

898
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,670
I just pretended not to know the academic achievement of my daughter.

899
01:22:26,670 --> 01:22:28,270
Not really do not know.

900
01:22:28,270 --> 01:22:31,210
Quick return to me!

901
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:34,810
Although it is difficult to be believed,

902
01:22:35,210 --> 01:22:37,080
no matter what people want to say,

903
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:39,880
I really never liked this place.

904
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:44,960
Since this is the birthplace of my husband.

905
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:48,960
And the place where my daughter passed her childhood.

906
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:59,370
This is the order of Kim Yeon Hong.

907
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:04,580

909
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:42,080
You have made a very funny joke.

910
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:47,950
My friend is dead, but the video was still in my hand.

911
01:23:53,690 --> 01:23:58,360

and broke a rib wife.

923

But something tells me all of this will never be finished.

929
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:43,790
