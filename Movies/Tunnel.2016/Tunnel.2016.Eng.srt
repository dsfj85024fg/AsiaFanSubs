<i>Stop barking. Come. </i>

2
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,110
<i>Hello! Stop barking.</i>

3
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:58,950
<i>Hello! Stop barking.</i>

4
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:59,980
<i>Hello! Stop barking.</i>

5
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,920
Do it slowly. Slowly.

6
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,420
All total 97,000 won.

7
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,090
All total 97,000 won.

8
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,090
I just told you to put in 3,000 worth.

9
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:41,760
What?

10
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,690
I said put in only 3,000 worth.


11
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,890
I told you before to just put
in 3,000 worth.

12
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,830
Aigoo. Did you mess it up 
again, grandfather?

13
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:47,230
I apologize, Customer!

14
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,050
I apologize, Customer!

15
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:48,300
I apologize, Customer!

16
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,370
This grandfather is a little
hard of hearing.

17
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,570
I told you if you wanted to 
do this job,

18
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:53,640
I told you if you wanted to
do this job,

19
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:53,770
you should wear your
hearing aid, okay?

20
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,370
you should wear your
hearing aid, okay?

21
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,840
Give it to me. I'll do it.
I will!

22
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,370
Give it to me. I'll do it.
I will!

23
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,440
It's fine. It's fine.

24
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,710
I'll need it anyway. 
Just give me the bill.

25
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,580
Okay. If you were in Riga (Latvia)
and filled this car with diesel,

26
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,920
Okay. If you were in Riga (Latvia)
and filled this car with diesel,

27
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,450
it might cost you $800.

28
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,120
Really?

29
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,920
I'm sorry.

30
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,260
Thank you.

31
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,860
Take care!

32
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,660
<i>Wait! Your water! </i>

33
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,540
Good. Thank you.

34
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,620
<i>I mean, they agreed to sign the
contract last week.</i>

35
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,290
<i>Now they're dragging their feet
and saying weird things,</i>

36
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,160
<i>so they must be looking around.</i>

37
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,560
=Tunnel ahead. Please drive
safely.=

38
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,360
If they signed the contract, 
I was going to buy you a bag.

39
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,100
Wait until next time.

40
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,630
=You shouldn't be wasting 
your money.=

41
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,500
=Just think about what to 
buy Su Jin for her birthday
besides a puppy.=

42
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,700
=Just think about what to
buy Su Jin for her birthday
besides a puppy.=

43
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,240
Our place is too small for a dog.

44
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,570
And they shed too much.

45
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,850
=Oh, I don't know. 
What time will you be here?=

46
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,110
I have to take the car into the
garage first.

47
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,920
The horn doesn't work.

48
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:17,450
=So, when will you be home?=

49
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:20,790
About 5:59 or so? 
I bought the cake.

50
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,660
Se Hyeon, I'll be home soon!

51
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,860
=Okay.=

52
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,460
Yes, Sir.

53
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,070
I am Lee Jeong Su with the 
Hado Agency. I'm driving 
now, so please go ahead.

54
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,000
=I told you that I needed 
10 cars.=

55
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,070
=But it turns out I'm a little
short of funds.=

56
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:43,350
=I've decided to buy 8. Can you 
include 3 fire extinguishers?=

57
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,620
Sir, my life's motto is all about
3 things.

58
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,890
Offer more. Deliver more.
Discount more.

59
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:50,690
Of course we can.

60
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,550
Especially since it affects 
children's safety.

61
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:58,160
=You're very refreshing. Then
I'll buy 8. Let's sign the contract 
on Monday.=

62
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,160
Thank you, Sir. I will continue 
to work hard.

63
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,770
=So, what is the total cost?=

64
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,170
I was a liberal arts major, so 
my math skills aren't very good.

65
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,840
I'll stop the car after this tunnel
and figure it out.

66
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,580
Then I'll call you right back.

67
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,780
=Okay, let's do that.=

68
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,050
I'll call you back in a minute.
Thank you.

69
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,150
What happened?

70
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,260
Hello?

71
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:35,290
=Dialing emergency 119.=

72
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,450
=Dialing emergency 119.=

73
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,110
=Dialing emergency 119.=

74
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,970
Hello?

75
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,980
=This is 119. What's your 
emergency?

76
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:47,250
Yes. The tunnel has collapsed
here and I'm trapped inside.

77
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,580
This is in...

78
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,920
=Sir, I can't hear you well. 
Please speak louder.=

79
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,320
- Okay. I'm here in...
=Hello?=

80
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,790
- The tunnel collapsed here.
=Hello?=

81
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,990
Tunnel! Tunnel collapse. 
Tunnel. Tunnel.

82
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:02,330
=Do you mean there are rocks 
in the tunnel?=

83
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:06,330
I said the tunnel collapsed.
Just now.

84
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,470
=It collapsed?=

85
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,340
Yes. Please come quickly.

86
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,470
=Which tunnel are you 
talking about?=

87
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,810
=Hello?=
- Hello?

88
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:20,080
=Sir, which tunnel are you 
talking about?=

89
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,880
=Hello? Hello, Sir?=

90
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,750
This is Hado Tunnel! 
Hado Tunnel!

91
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,620
=Hado Tunnel?=
- Yes.

92
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,020
=The Hado Tunnel on Highway
18, is that right?=

93
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:29,820
That's right.

94
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:34,230
It's collapsed inside and I'm 
trapped in here.

95
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,500
Hello? Hello?

96
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,970
=This is 119 headquarters.=

97
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,900
=Did you say the tunnel has 
collapsed around your car?=

98
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,640
I said the tunnel collapsed...

99
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,840
There are rocks on top of me
and rocks all around.

100
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,650
=So how bad does the collapse
seem?=

101
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:56,120
Very serious. It's completely
caved in.

102
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,850
Stop asking. Can't you just
come quickly?

103
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:04,130
=Yes, yes. Sir, what is your
name?=

104
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,460
Lee Jeong Su. Lee Jeong Su.

105
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,930
I'm with the Hado Kia Agency. 
Lee Jeong Su.

106
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:07,600
=Okay.=

107
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,660
How long will it be?

108
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:13,070
=Lee Jeong Su. Okay. If there's
no traffic, they should be there
in 5 minutes.=

109
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,140
Hello? Mister.

110
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,870
=Please wait in a safe place.=

111
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:16,940
Hello?

112
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,080
Safe place? What bullshit.

113
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,320
If he'd only put in $30 worth
of gas,

114
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,720
I would have made it through
this tunnel. Seriously.

115
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,080
-=119 Rescue Team=-

116
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,020
=How is the tunnel?=

117
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,360
=What?=

118
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,300
Dear viewers, there has been
another disaster in our country.

119
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:55,570
Dear viewers, there has been
another disaster in our country.

120
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:56,900
This time, a tunnel.

121
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:01,580
Just a month after opening, a
tunnel has tragically collapsed.

122
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:01,710
Just a month after opening, a
tunnel has tragically collapsed.

123
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:08,920
Now just as you all can see, 
the mountain above the tunnel
has completely collapsed.

124
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,540
There is a slide at the area of 
construction above the tunnel.

125
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,990
There is a slide at the area of
construction above the tunnel.

126
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:15,590
The entrance to the north side 
of the tunnel is completely 
blocked.

127
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:19,330
From the south entrance, it 
looks as if there was an attack.

128
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,460
Everything is pitch-black 
from the dust.

129
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,010
<i>Because of the new construction,</i>

130
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:23,330
<i>Because of the new construction,</i>

131
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:25,730
<i>there was almost no traffic
through the Hado Tunnel.</i>

132
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,340
<i>But the first call made to 119</i>

133
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,140
<i>was made from someone inside
the tunnel.</i>

134
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,610
<i>Inside the collapsed tunnel,</i>

135
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,880
<i>at least one person has been
trapped.</i>

136
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,280
<i>Consideration is being given as 
to how to approach the incident.</i>

137
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:40,010
<i>The identity of the person in the
tunnel is now confirmed.</i>

138
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:44,550
<i>He is a 38-year-old car salesman
from Hado.</i>

139
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,150
<i>Once again.</i>

140
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,820
<i>The first call from the Hado 
Tunnel came from a 38-year-old
man.</i>

141
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,490
<i>The first call from the Hado
Tunnel came from a 38-year-old
man.</i>

<i>He has been identified as
Lee Jeong Su. </i>

<i>He has been identified as
Lee Jeong Su. </i>

144
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:56,830
<i>We have determined the man
trapped in the collapsed tunnel
is Lee Jeong Su.</i>

145
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,140
Hello?

146
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,680
=Hello? Is this Lee Jeong Su?=

147
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,480
Yes.

148
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,550
=You're the Lee Jeong Su who's 
trapped in the tunnel, right?=

=You're the Lee Jeong Su who's
trapped in the tunnel, right?=

150
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:48,220
Yes, have you arrived?

151
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,950
=Hurry, connect us!=

=I am SNC reporter,

=It's okay with you if we 
broadcast this interview, right?=

=Broadcasting this will be
helpful in trying to save you.=

157
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,360
-=Exclusive phone interview 
with survivor. News flash.=-

158
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,040
<i>The rescue work has already
begun,</i>

159
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,840
<i>but it may take a long time
due to the size of the slide.</i>

160
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,640
=Do you have any food in there
with you?=

161
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,110
You said it may take a long 
time.

162
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,180
What does that mean?

163
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,990
=You mean the rescue team 
hasn't told you the plan?=

164
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:29,190
Just how long a period of time
are you talking about?

165
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,460
They can't get me out of here
immediately?

166
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:34,930
=It seems they haven't 
explained the situation to you.=

167
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,930
=They aren't sure about the
Hado side,=

168
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,870
=but the Seoul side has 
completely collapsed.=

169
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,470
=The entrance is totally 
destroyed.=

170
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,210
=Lee Jeong Su, what is your
mood right now?=

171
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:47,880
Hey! Where the hell is that 
call from?

172
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,880
Hey! Where the hell is that
call from?

173
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,000
<i>It seems like the staging area.</i>

174
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,210
<i>It seems like the staging area.</i>

175
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,350
Then you should stop it, Kid!

176
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,350
He'll deplete his battery.

177
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,890
Hey, hey, hey you! Hurry and 
hang up the phone!

178
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,760
If you keep this up, his phone
will go dead!

179
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,690
If you keep this up, his phone
will go dead!

180
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,160
But they're broadcasting live.

181
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,160
It will end soon. Very soon.

182
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,030
This guy is really pissing me off.

183
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,230
Please go ahead.

184
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,440
=Yes, Lee Jeong Su.=

185
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,170
Hang that up right now!

186
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,770
<i>What do you think you're doing?</i>

187
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,910
<i>What the hell are you all doing?</i>

188
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,640
<i>The victim's phone has now 
been disconnected.</i>

189
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,180
=We will sort out the situation
and report again.=

190
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:28,320
Who the hell are you? You just
screwed up a live broadcast!

191
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,450
Did you not see the story that
was just on the air?

192
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:37,260
Reporters, right now is your
story more important or is a 
life more important?

193
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,530
What?

194
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,860
You can't answer a simple 
question?

195
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,270
If because of you,

196
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,400
that person's phone battery
goes dead,

197
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,540
because of being isolated,

198
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,470
he will become anxious with 
fast heartbeat and breathing
difficulty!

199
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,140
Because of inadequate oxygen,
his blood flow will slow down!

200
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,750
Due to long-term lack of energy 
his heart will stop beating!

201
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,680
What then, Mr. Reporter?
Will you take responsibility?

202
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,090
That's for Lee Jeong Su...

203
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:07,290
This is a lifeline! A lifeline!

204
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,160
This is a lifeline! A lifeline!

205
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,630
If you call him again,

206
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,360
you will be in violation of article
18 of the media responsibility law.

207
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,570
Please. Don't call him.

208
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,710
Why is this van still parked here?

209
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,840
Get it out of here! Right now!

210
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,780
<i>Hey! Why are you letting
cars come in here?</i>

211
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,380
<i>Can't you keep them out of here?</i>

212
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,250
<i>Can't you even restrict access
here?</i>

213
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,390
Our car shouldn't even be here!

214
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,790
They didn't stop and just drove
right through.

215
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:41,860
Sang Hun.

216
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,520
Yes.

217
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,460
Charge this.

218
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,260
Okay.

219
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,530
Good job. It's true that 
knowledge is power.

220
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,400
There was nothing they 
could say.

221
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,670
What was that media law you
just mentioned?

222
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:54,140
Just something I threw out.

223
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,070
It's not real?

224
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,400
Those reporters didn't say 
anything.

225
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,270
It looks like they weren't even
sure about it.

226
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,140
Kid, go check the rescue
regulations.

227
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,810
-=1. Definition of collapse.=-

228
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,820
There aren't any instructions
in here?

229
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:12,690
It's in English and still being
translated.

230
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,430
Translate this into English 
and return it to them.

231
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,360
Captain, Lee Jeong Su called.

232
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:24,830
Hey, close them. Close them.

233
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,700
Hello, Lee Jeong Su. I'm the 
rescue team captain, Kim Dae 
Gyeong.

234
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,570
=Why do you never answer 
the phone?=

235
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:31,510
What?

236
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,440
=What are you all doing?=

237
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,580
=Didn't you just say you 
would rescue me quickly?=

238
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,780
=Is it different than that?=

239
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,310
Lee Jeong Su, calm down and
listen to me.

240
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,780
=How can you tell me to 
calm down?=

241
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,980
Hurry and explain this to me.

242
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,190
What's going on out there now? 
Just tell me the truth!

243
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,250
=Lee Jeong Su, if you're like 
this, I can't talk to you.=

244
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,660
Hey, you son of a bitch!
Then who can I talk to?

245
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,060
=Then give someone else the 
phone! Let me talk to the 
person in charge!=

246
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:57,800
Lee Jeong Su, I am the person
in charge. You need to listen.

247
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,740
Son of a bitch, then hurry up.

248
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,540
=Lee Jeong Su, listen to what
I say.=

249
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,810
=First, Lee Jeong Su, you have
to calm down.=

250
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,610
I am... right now I'm calm.
Just hurry and tell me.

251
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,750
Then you need to do this. Lee 
Jeong Su, take a deep breath.

252
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:18,620
Just follow me and take a deep 
breath.

253
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,430
I'm already breathing so just
tell me.

254
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:31,970
=I'm sorry. I am the rescue 
leader, Kim Dae Gyeong.=

255
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:35,040
Lee Jeong Su, how much charge
is left on your phone battery?

256
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,780
It's at 78%. Why? Why are you
asking that?

257
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,250
=Yes. Well, I'm going to tell
you the truth now.=

258
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,910
=First of all, this situation is 
not very simple.=

259
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,650
=Of course, we will definitely
rescue you.=

260
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:51,190
But it's probably going to take
some time is what I'm saying.

261
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,450
The Minister wants to come.

262
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,190
Minister?

263
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:00,530
Lee Jeong Su, do you have any
water in the car?

264
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:01,600
Water or drinks,

265
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,460
or any food?

266
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:14,540
Hello? Hello? Lee Jeong Su?

267
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,540
Come on, come on. 
Get it together.

268
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,080
Lee Jeong Su, do you have any
water? Water?

269
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,080
Please answer me. Lee Jeong Su?

270
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,690
I have 2 bottles of water and 
a cake.

271
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,220
Okay. How many milliliters?

272
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:33,230
They're small, 500 mL and a 
cream cake.

273
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,830
The cake won't last a long time.

274
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,700
You should probably eat that
quickly.

275
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,900
And the water, the water...
That's very important.

276
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,370
=I think you'll have to make it
last about 7 days.=

277
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:46,840
=Mark it. Be sure to drink as 
much as possible.=

278
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,380
=And drink without it touching
your lips,=

279
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,850
=so the water won't become
polluted.=

280
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:53,510
Wait.

281
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,180
=You understand, right?=

282
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,980
So you mean, I'll have to be
here for a week?

283
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,050
You will be rescued before you 
drink all that water.

284
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,390
Lee Jeong Su, you understand
what I explained to you about 
the water, right?

285
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:09,930
Don't touch my mouth. 
Divide it to last for one week.

286
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,670
Very good. You remembered 
it correctly.

287
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:15,270
Lee Jeong Su, do you happen
to know your present position?

288
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:18,470
In other words, about how far
are you from the tunnel entrance?

289
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:21,140
=This is very important for 
the rescue.=

290
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:26,210
Oh, yes. I was quite far into it.

291
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:30,220
There's a ventilation fan that
fell on top of me.

292
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,090
What? Ventilation fan? 
There's a fan on top of the car?

293
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,690
Hey. Hurry and get the plans.

294
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:39,430
Okay. A ventilation fan on the 
car is very important information.

295
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,160
Go over there.

296
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,100
<i>Okay. We're looking at the 
diagrams, so hold on a moment.</i>

297
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,570
<i>We have the plans now.</i>

298
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,570
You just tore them.

299
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,440
=Look, there's no problem.=

300
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,440
Could you see the exit when
you entered the tunnel?

301
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,710
=No. I couldn't see it.=

302
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,710
Okay.

303
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,450
=There isn't anything else?=

304
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:03,320
I went around the bend. After 
that, I drove inside.

305
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,520
I can't remember.

306
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:10,660
Okay. Fine. Lee Jeong Su. 
From now on at 12:00,

307
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,590
we'll contact you. 
But for today,

308
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,330
turn your phone off immediately.

309
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:17,060
Who did you say you are again?

310
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:21,070
=Yes. Kim Dae Gyeong, rescue 
team leader.=

311
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:28,010
Please tell me the truth. 
Can you save me?

312
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:32,410
We have saved many people
in this country.

313
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:36,680
You'll be out of there very soon.
You and I will meet on that day.

314
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,030
Hey. Put it there. Geez.

315
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,970
Five ventilation fans and Lee 
Jeong Su is under one of them.

316
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:57,640
Five ventilation fans and Lee
Jeong Su is under one of them.

317
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,200
Okay. Okay. Okay.

318
00:22:59,200 --> 00:22:59,370
Okay. Okay. Okay.

319
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:19,930
Honey. Honey.

320
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:23,000
=Honey, are you okay? 
Are you injured?=

321
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,200
I'm okay.

322
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:35,280
I'm really okay. I'll get out.

323
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,810
They told me it will be about
one week from now.

324
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:42,880
Don't worry. Don't cry. 
I'll get out of here very soon.

325
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,490
You should save your battery. 
Just talk to me for a minute.

326
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:55,160
Su Jin. Does Su Jin know?

327
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:59,300
I told her you were busy at 
work and couldn't come home. 
Do you want to talk to her?

328
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,770
Yes. Put her on.

329
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:17,320
Su Jin. Daddy bought your cake
and was bringing it home.

330
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,650
Su Jin. Daddy bought your cake
and was bringing it home.

331
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:21,460
But something happened and I
can't come. I'm sorry.

332
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:26,930
Daddy, I'm going to grandma's 
house. Can you come there?

333
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:30,800
I want to get my cake and my
the gift. My puppy.

334
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:35,470
Right. Daddy will buy the 
puppy and then come.

335
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:40,270
=Really? Mom! Daddy said he'll
come after he buys the puppy!=

336
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,080
=I'm taking Su Jin to my mom's
house and then I'll come there.=

337
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,210
No, no, no. Just stay there.

338
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,280
=I'm coming.=

339
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,220
Okay.

340
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:53,740
<i>The tunnel length is 1.9 km.</i>

341
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,340
<i>Lee Jeong Su's position</i>

342
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,410
<i>is in one of the 5 areas marked
here.</i>

343
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:02,150
<i>The lowest place is more than 
100 meters deep and there are 
many rocks.</i>

344
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:05,890
So going from the south 
entrance seems the most 
effective method.

345
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:09,360
After we confirm the situation
tomorrow, we will decide 
whether we begin there.

346
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:15,500
The implementation of rescue
efforts should be discussed with
experts.

347
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,970
Everyone must treat this as
if it were their own family,

348
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,430
and put in their best effort.

349
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:24,840
Also, there is construction 
nearby for a second Hado tunnel.

350
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,110
That will be suspended for now.

351
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,710
There's another tunnel here?

352
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:32,980
Yes. It's currently under 
construction nearby.

353
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,980
They were working on the 
final section.

354
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:39,520
Will the second tunnel in the
area also be affected?

355
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,790
Because the opening of the new
Hado city is not far away,

356
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,060
it must be completed as soon 
as possible.

357
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,730
Consult the experts and then 
get started.

358
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,860
Let's do all that we can.

359
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,410
<i>Will that be enough now?</i>

360
00:27:59,410 --> 00:27:59,670
<i>Are there enough here now?</i>

361
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:00,870
<i>Yes.</i>

362
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:05,680
Wait, wait, wait! We have to
change cards. Just a moment.

363
00:28:07,848 --> 00:28:09,950
Such a headache.

364
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:15,290
Here we go! The people in 
front, crouch down a bit.

365
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:16,220
<i>Get a bit lower.</i>

366
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,820
<i>Crouch down a bit lower.</i>

367
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,830
<i>You're blocking our view!</i>

368
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,030
<i>Okay. Thank you!</i>

369
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:21,960
<i>Let's go. Let's go.</i>

370
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,030
Okay.

371
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:35,310
<i>Send them in now! Send them!</i>

372
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:40,110
<i>We don't want the drones to 
hit anyone!</i>

373
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,120
<i>Please don't get too close!</i>

374
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,660
What the hell's going on?

375
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,400
Okay.

376
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,960
What? What happened?

377
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:27,630
They lost the signal.

378
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,300
It's not very far from here.

379
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:36,570
They have a range of 5 km.

380
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:39,640
If the signal is weak, then the
range will be shorter.

381
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,440
There must be a lot of iron ore
in there.

382
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:47,380
If wireless doesn't work, 
can't you use wired ones?

383
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:49,520
This is the only type of device
I have.

384
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,250
But if you want to get through
there,

385
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,850
we have some at the factory.

386
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,990
Okay. Then call a courier to 
deliver them quickly.

387
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,990
What are you doing? 
Where's your factory?

388
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:58,990
Ontario. In America.

389
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:10,260
Aigoo.

390
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,870
Hey. You stay here.

391
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,670
Can you do it alone?

392
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:17,470
Yes.

393
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,220
The whole thing is collapsed.

394
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,240
Your wife is on the phone!

395
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,580
Tell her I'll call her back.

396
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,380
And you, don't honk that horn.
Got it?

397
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,850
<i>I'm sorry!</i>

398
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,320
Idiot.

399
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,190
Has he gone crazy?

400
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,190
What?

401
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,530
Sorry, I pressed it by accident. 
Sorry.

402
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:28,610
<i>Captain!</i>

403
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:31,280
<i>Lee Jeong Su is on the phone!</i>

404
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,550
Yes, Lee Jeong Su.

405
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,820
Is there someone around here?

406
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,760
=What?=

407
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,690
I think I just heard a car horn
honk twice.

408
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:46,360
=Really?=

409
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,900
Oh! I heard it again! Again!

410
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,970
That... is me.

411
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,970
He can hear that?

412
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:03,310
I just heard the horn honk 
5 times again.

413
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:05,310
Yes, yes! Lee Jeong Su.

414
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:08,380
We might see you sooner than
we expected.

415
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,320
=Really?=

416
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,050
=Thank you! Thank you!=

417
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:56,960
Lee Jeong Su, get down in 
your car immediately!

418
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,430
=Protect yourself!=

419
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:28,660
-=Hado Tunnel - Safe and 
Happy Construction=-

420
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,220
-=Hado Tunnel - Safe and
Happy Construction=-

421
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:34,390
The phone! Phone! Phone!

422
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:38,400
<i>Captain! Captain!</i>

423
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,730
Captain, are you all right?

424
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:40,670
Give me a phone!

425
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,670
<i>You can't come in! You can't!</i>

426
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,900
Hello? Lee Jeong Su!

427
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:16,170
Can you hear me? Can you hear?

428
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,580
I hear you.

429
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,520
=Are you okay?=

430
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,860
It collapsed a bit more, 
but I'm okay.

431
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:44,600
There was just another major 
collapse at the entrance!

432
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,400
=I'm sorry.=

433
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:58,340
It says ventilation fan #3.

434
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,280
=Number 3. Number 3.=

435
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,350
Your wife...

436
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,420
What did you say?

437
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,150
=It looks like your wife has
come here.=

438
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,620
=Do you want to talk to her?=

439
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:12,090
Yes. Put her on. Put her on.

440
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:15,700
=Oppa, are you okay?=

441
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:19,430
Did you have breakfast?

442
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,100
You're asking me that now?

443
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,970
=I'm really fine.=

444
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:26,110
I'll call you again later.

445
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,370
Remember to eat breakfast.

446
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,750
Yesterday at 8:30 a.m.,

447
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:15,620
the rescue team was able to 
accurately locate Lee Jeong Su's
position.

448
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:19,090
From the surface, we plan to 
drill about 180 meters down,

449
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:21,900
to open a rescue channel 
towards Lee Jeong Su.

450
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:32,570
We also intend to enter from 
the south entrance.

451
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:32,710
1. Top (vertical) excavation.
2-Track method.
Underground Location.
Lee Jeong Su (38)

Underground Location.
Lee Jeong Su (38)

453
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,970
1. Top (vertical) excavation.
2-Track method.
Underground Location.
Lee Jeong Su (38)

454
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:35,780
According to the President's 
orders,

455
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,980
According to the President's
orders,

456
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:42,320
<i>we will use all means possible 
in order to save Lee Jeong Su.</i>

457
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,790
Therefore, our rescue team feels
using a 2-track method

458
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,920
will be the fastest way to 
carry out the rescue.

459
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,590
Our government will do its best.

460
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,330
This is Lee Jeong Su's wife.

461
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,870
Aigoo. Aigoo.

462
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:06,070
I will rely on you. 
I will rely on you.

463
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,740
They want to take a photo.

464
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,080
<i>Please look this way.</i>

465

476
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:01,770
Why are you here?

477
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:16,990
Hello? Is someone out there?

478
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,590
<i>I'm over here.</i>

479
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:26,070

<i>Please help me!</i>

482
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,610
Wait a moment.

483
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,680
<i>Ajussi!</i>

484
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,210
<i>You're not leaving are you?
Please don't leave me!</i>

485
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:41,950
I'm not going anywhere. Wait.
I'm stuck here too.

486
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:43,820
I'm not going anywhere. Wait.
I'm stuck here too.

487
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:44,520
-=Rescue Captain, there is

488
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:48,220
I'm coming, so wait just a bit.

489
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:34,530
<i>Ajussi, you're coming aren't you?</i>

490
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:37,600
Yes, I'm coming. Hang on.

491
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:53,090
<i>Did something happen?</i>

492
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:57,360
It's okay. I'm coming. It's fine.

493
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,090
I'm fine. Nothing happened.

494
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:01,230
It's all right.

495
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:04,560
I'm on my way.

496
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,500
That hurts.

497
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:17,780
Almost there.

498
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:22,720
Mutt.

499
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,050
You're in here.

500
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:41,000
I... I can't move.

501
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,810
I need to get in there first.

502
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:48,610
Okay.

503
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,420
You need to move.

504
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:08,490
I'll try to move some of the
rocks and see.

505
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:15,170
I'm sorry. It's very tight here.

506
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:48,000
It won't even budge.

507
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:54,940
Are you okay?

508
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:57,480
Ajussi, the light.

509
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,480
The light.

510
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:03,080
Otherwise I'm fine.

511
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:06,690
But my ribs hurt a bit.

512
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:08,020
Your ribs?

513
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:09,620
Should I try to move the 
chair back?

514
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:11,760
I don't think it will move.

515
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:22,170
How long have we been
trapped in here?

516
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:28,710
I think about 2 days and 
7 hours.

517
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:32,580
What's going to happen to us?

518
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:36,180
Will we die?

519
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:39,650
No. Right now, all of South 
Korea is out there.

520
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:42,190
They're doing everything they
can to rescue us.

521
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:44,460
Is that true?

522
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:45,660
Of course.

523
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:48,190
Thank goodness.

524
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,330
So when are we going to get out?

525
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:55,270
Probably...

526
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:00,210
When I talked to them on 
the phone,

527
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:04,080
they said it would probably 
take a few days.

528
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:09,010
He doesn't have any injuries?

529
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:10,350
I don't think so.

530
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:11,680
He still seems pretty lively.

531
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:15,150
But, what kind of collar is this?

532
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:17,290
It's a bark-control collar.

533
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:22,500
Tangie. Tangie?

534
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:24,360
Tangie, come here.

535
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,830
Tangie.

536
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,580
Do you... I'm sorry.

537
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:38,510
What?

538
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:42,380
Do you have any water?

539
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,320
Water?

540
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:49,190
I have some in my car.
I'll go get it.

541
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:21,490
Enough?

542
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,160
A little... a little more.

543
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:34,570
It's not good to drink very 
much all of a sudden.

544
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:38,570
Just drink a little bit to get 
your throat moist.

545
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:44,180
That's fine.

546
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:48,980
Ajussi.

547
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:49,520
Yes.

548
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:54,450
Could you give Tangie a bit?

549
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:00,460
Just pour a little in your hands.

550
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:02,860
Okay. Of course.

551
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:10,470
Tangie, come here.
Ajussi will give you a drink.

552
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:13,140
No, no. You can't come 
that way.

553
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:15,540
Come this way. 
Tangie, come here.

554
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,010
Right.

555
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:20,750
Here.

556
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:29,690
Ajussi.

557
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:31,290
That's good.

558
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:36,630
Can you help me look for 
my phone?

559
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:46,370
It's all broken. It won't turn on.

560
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:53,180
I'm sorry to trouble you again.

561
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:54,250
What?

562
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:57,720
Could I use your phone
for a moment?

563
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:00,250
I need to make a call.

564
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:01,990
Okay.

565
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:07,730
I'll help you.

566
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:18,140
Mom, it's me. Mi Na.

567
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:20,670
Yes.

568
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:25,210
What should I do? 
What should I do?

569
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,410
Mom.

570
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:35,350
I'm... trapped inside a tunnel.

571
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,690
Yes. Yes.

572
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:48,700
No. I'm not alone.

573
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:52,710
I'm here with another man.

574
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:54,710
Don't worry.

575
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:58,580
I'll be able to get out in a few
days.

576
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:00,850
Yes.

577
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:07,920
Mom, I miss you.

578
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:16,600
But Mom, I can't talk very long.

579
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:18,600
We have to save the battery.

580
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:26,610
And Mom, would you call 
my work for me?

581
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:29,140
Explain everything to them.

582
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:31,940
Mom, don't cry.

583
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:37,680
I'm okay.

584
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:42,890
Ajussi, we're going to be out
in a few days, right?

585
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:44,360
Yes. Of course.

586
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:48,230
Mom, we'll be out of here
within a week.

587
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:58,240
Tell them I'll be able to attend
the new staff training.

588
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:07,310
Also...

589
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:12,380
your car is completely wrecked.

590
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:13,990
I'm sorry, Mom.

591
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:21,730
Yes. I'll call you again later.

592
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:23,460
Yes.

593
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:27,200
Ajussi.

594
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:27,870
Yes.

595
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:29,740
My Mom wants to talk to you.

596
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:30,800
What?

597
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:33,610
Me?

598
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:42,550
Yes, I'm Lee Jeong Su with
the Kia Hado Agency.

599
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:43,480
Hello.

600
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:46,550
Yes.

601
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:50,560
I'll take good care of Mi Na.

602
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,760
I'll bring her out of here. 
Don't worry.

603
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,560
Yes. We have water.

604
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,160
She just drank a lot of water.

605
00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:01,630
Yes. Yes. Thank you.

606
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:03,100
Goodbye. Yes.

607
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:11,780
Mi Na, I brought these socks.

608
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:14,050
I was going to let you wear
them.

609
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:17,650
You can use them to wipe 
all your tears if you cry.

610
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:18,980
Okay.

611
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,920
Aigoo. Does it hurt?

612
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:24,190
This side is dirty. Is it okay?

613
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:25,790
Yes, it's fine.

614
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:33,670
-=Clear Water Motel=-

615
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:40,340
Enjoy your meal.

616
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:41,540
Thank you.

617
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:43,680
We reserved a heated room
for you.

618
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,810
This is the key and the invoice.

619
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,010
Thank you.

620
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:49,550
The room should have been
covered,

621
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:51,280
but there's a lot of red tape.

622
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,890
Hold onto the invoice and it
can be handled later.

623
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:55,690
Okay.

00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:50,940
Ajussi, what do you do?

631
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:52,680
My career?

632
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:53,210
Yes.

633
00:55:53,210 --> 00:55:55,210
I'm a salesman at the Hado
Kia agency.

634
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:56,550
=This is FM 94.2.=

635
00:55:56,550 --> 00:55:57,220
It works.

636
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,820
=Classical music channel.=

637
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:04,820
Classical. Classical.

638
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:08,960
It's not bad. I don't mind
classical music.

639
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:10,830
Do you like classical music?

640
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:14,700
I heard it for the first time after
I graduated from high school.

641
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:27,110
Are you all right?

642
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:28,450
I'm fine.

643
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:32,320
Ajussi, I'm going to sleep for 
a while.

644
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,390
Okay. I'll go back to my car.

645
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:36,990
If you need anything, call me.

646
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,590
And, there's this.

647
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:43,660
Here is the button.

648
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:46,470
Keep this light off or the 
battery will die.

649
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,340
I'll leave it on until you 
get back to your car.

650
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:51,800
Thank you.

651
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:53,270
It was nice to meet you.

652
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,020
Mi Na, turn on the light!

653
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:08,350
I'm sorry. Tangie is biting 
the flashlight.

654
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:09,820
Tangie, let go.

655
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:13,160
Tangie, that little son of a bitch.

656
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:14,490
That son of a bitch.

657
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:21,300
I'm home. I'm back home.

658
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:30,240
Daddy will be out of here
very soon.

659
00:57:30,910 --> 00:57:33,180
Daddy will be out of here
very soon.

660
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:52,400
We can share that.

661
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:03,080
What?

662
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:11,880
You son of a bitch!

663
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:13,750
You son of a bitch!

664
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:18,020
Son of a bitch!

665
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:21,490
Damn it!

666
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:26,830
That was my Su Jin's cake!

667
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:29,900
You son of a bitch. Damn you!

668
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:33,240
<i>Ajussi, is something wrong?</i>

669
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:39,240
No. I was dreaming. Dreaming.

670
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:53,390
Eat some of this.

671
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:55,930
Aigoo. That's enough!

672
00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:57,260
Eat it while it's hot.

673
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:58,330
You should rest.

674
00:58:58,330 --> 00:59:01,000
You're all working so hard to 
save my husband.

675
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:01,670
Thank you.

676
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:02,870
I should do something.

677
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:03,670
<i>Thank you.</i>

678
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:05,540
Enjoy your food!

679
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:23,690
Let me get you some...

680
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:25,420
That's okay. That's okay.

681
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:30,500
It's fine. It's fine.

682
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:44,780
<i>Ajussi.</i>

683
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:53,590
<i>Ajussi, come here.</i>

684
00:59:55,850 --> 00:59:57,060
Okay!

685
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:07,470
Ajussi, will it take them a long
time to get here?

686
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,670
They'll come for us very soon.
Just wait a little longer.

687
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:12,540
He said they're definitely
coming.

688
01:00:13,870 --> 01:00:16,410
Mi Na, are you okay?

689
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:27,490
My ribs hurt so it's hard to
breathe.

690
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:32,820
Just hold on a little longer.

691
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,360
I'll go call them.

692
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:42,970
Ajussi, I'm sorry, but do you
have any water?

693
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:52,840
I'm sorry, but I drank it all.

694
01:00:55,910 --> 01:00:58,320
Wait, Mi Na. I'll go get some 
for you.

695
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,320
Wait a moment.

696
01:01:32,350 --> 01:01:35,420
Okay. There's a little bit left.

697
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:39,020
Tangie, you'd better stay away.

698
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:41,030
You know what this is, right?

699
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:52,240
Mi Na. Mi Na?

700
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,580
Mi Na.

701
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:15,860
What's wrong? Don't scare me.

702
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,810
Mi Na, I brought water.

703
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:34,850
Mi Na.

704
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:41,890
Hold on. I'll help you move
back.

705
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,190
Mi Na, I'm sorry.

706
01:04:43,610 --> 01:04:45,880
<i>Yesterday, a victim in the Hado 
Tunnel died.</i>

707
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:48,280
<i>An investigation is underway 
into the cause for the collapse.</i>

708
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:51,750
<i>A lot of information is emerging
regarding shoddy construction.</i>

709
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:56,150
<i>Two-thirds of our 121 tunnels
were recently inspected.</i>

710
01:04:56,150 --> 01:05:00,160
<i>More than 78 tunnels are not up
to standards, which is causing 
widespread concern.</i>

711

<i>More than 78 tunnels are not up
to standards, which is causing
widespread concern.</i>

712
01:05:02,030 --> 01:05:03,430
<i>During construction of a tunnel,

<i>During construction of a tunnel,

<i>During construction of a tunnel,
in order to prevent the collapse
of the rock,</i>

715
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:07,900
<i>each section should have 10 
anchor bolts.</i>

716
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:11,740
<i>But it's not visible from the 
outside, so no one does. Who's 
going to know?</i>

717
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:12,040
<i>But it's not visible from the

outside, so no one does. Who's
going to know?</i>

719
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:14,840
<i>In Korea, there's not one company
that follows FM standards.</i>

720
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:17,140
<i>That's just tempting fate, 
isn't that right?</i>

721
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:17,510
<i>That's just tempting fate,
isn't that right?</i>

722
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,380
Didn't you say you'd rescue me
before I drank all the water?

723
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:25,520
=Yes. I'm sorry.=

724
01:05:28,590 --> 01:05:32,320
Truthfully, you can't do it, right?

725
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:35,660
No. We will. I will get you out.

726
01:05:36,590 --> 01:05:38,200
Just wait a while longer.

727
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:41,000
We will definitely get in there.

728
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:47,410
=You're saving urine in the 
empty bottles, right?=

729
01:05:49,270 --> 01:05:51,680
Urine is sterile, so you can
drink it.

730
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:53,680
Did you drink it before?

731
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:59,280
=I'm sorry. I never have.=

732

-=9 days after collapse=-

733
01:06:53,870 --> 01:06:55,610
Go away, brat.

734
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:03,080
What is that?

735
01:07:20,030 --> 01:07:21,230
Where did this come from?

736
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:36,180
You ate my cake last time.

737
01:07:36,450 --> 01:07:39,120
Two for me. One for you.

738
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:43,920
My nose is bigger than yours,
so I get four.

739
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,590
You get two.

740
01:07:49,930 --> 01:07:51,260
Understand?

741
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:55,270
Okay, Tangie. Eat up.

742
01:07:55,270 --> 01:08:01,810
Eat. Eat. It's okay. Relax. 
It's okay. Relax.

743
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:08,210
Your food needs seasoning.

744
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:17,960
Don't look. Don't look.

745
01:08:18,490 --> 01:08:20,360
Don't look. Look away.

746
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:26,630
Here it is.

747
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:35,310
I absolutely won't let you
open this.

748
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:38,640
Should I take this off?

749
01:08:40,110 --> 01:08:41,980
Wow. This is something.

750
01:08:53,590 --> 01:08:55,190
Bad dog.

751
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:02,000
Be still. It has a button.

752
01:09:02,530 --> 01:09:04,940
Is this nice?

753
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:50,700
You need to learn to bury it 
like a cat does.

754
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:54,170
Who do you think is going to 
clean up after you?

755
01:11:54,170 --> 01:11:55,510
Who will pick it up?

756
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:25,400
There's no way I could 
drink your urine.

757
01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:29,540
Yes.

758
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:30,470
How is the digging progressing?

759
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:31,540
How is the digging progressing?

760
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:33,540
=Because it's relatively hard, 
it's been going slowly.=

761
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:37,150
=Within 10 days we should 
surely be through.=

762
01:12:37,150 --> 01:12:40,480
=Plus, we have to shore up the
tunnel entrance properly.=

763
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:42,750
=We should start digging today.=

764
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:48,890
22. 23. 24.

765
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:56,100
24. 10.

766
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:04,510
Lee Jeong Su, I... drank urine.

767
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:09,710
Why would you drink urine?

768
01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:13,050
I had never done it, so I felt
bad telling you to do it.

769
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:17,460
Also... don't drink it right away.

770
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:21,190
Let it cool first. That helps.

771
01:13:22,660 --> 01:13:26,400
You've given me a lot of 
encouragement. Thank you.

772
01:13:38,410 --> 01:13:39,880
Do you want some?

773
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:47,750
Tangie, this is orange juice.

774
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:52,160
My body can squeeze out 
orange juice.

775
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:54,290
That's weird, right?

776
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:46,940
Honey, I found water.
Drinking water.

777
01:15:46,940 --> 01:15:49,340
=It tasted sweet.=

778
01:15:49,340 --> 01:15:50,540
=Sweet water?=

779
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:53,610
=Don't be worrying about me.=

780
01:15:53,610 --> 01:15:56,410
=You must eat properly, okay?=

781
01:15:57,210 --> 01:15:58,950
=Okay. I'll call you later.=

782
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:08,690
Are you doing okay?

783
01:16:10,290 --> 01:16:12,700
I heard you drank urine.

784
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:17,500
How much did you drink?

785
01:16:17,770 --> 01:16:20,300
Seriously, he shouldn't have
told you.

786
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:27,510
It was a paper cup. 
Not like this one...

787
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:30,850
About the size of that one.

788
01:16:31,650 --> 01:16:32,850
Do you want a drink?

789
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:34,720
Drink it yourself.

790
01:16:37,390 --> 01:16:38,990
=As our audience friends know,=

791
01:16:38,990 --> 01:16:41,930
=the only radio station Lee 
Jeong Su can receive=

792
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:44,600
=in the tunnel is our station.=

793
01:16:45,130 --> 01:16:47,930
=If the rescue team loses 
contact with him before the 
rescue,=

794
01:16:47,930 --> 01:16:50,200
=we will broadcast at 12:00=

795
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:55,270
=for 5 minutes to pass the 
rescue news to Lee Jeong Su.=

796
01:16:55,270 --> 01:16:57,940
=We hope everyone can 
understand.=

797
01:17:23,570 --> 01:17:26,500
This is the top of the tunnel 
structure.

798
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:26,770
This is the top of the tunnel
structure.

799
01:17:26,770 --> 01:17:27,040
It came out this morning. 
If we keep drilling overnight,

800
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:31,310
It came out this morning.
If we keep drilling overnight,

801
01:17:31,310 --> 01:17:35,450
we expect to reach the 
underground tunnel tomorrow.

802
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:35,580
Lee Jeong Su will be out soon!

803
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:38,000
Lee Jeong Su will be out soon!

804
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:38,380
Lee Jeong Su will be out soon!

805
01:17:39,450 --> 01:17:41,590
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

806
01:18:02,270 --> 01:18:04,260
-=Mom: Mom will be bringing 
Dad over there soon.=-

807
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:05,740
-=Su Jin: And the puppy?=-

808
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:09,880
Seonbae.

809
01:18:10,810 --> 01:18:14,020
We think it will be soon. 
Let's go.

810
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:19,220
I guess I fell asleep.
I'm so tired.

811
01:18:23,490 --> 01:18:25,630
Wow. That's too bad.

812
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:28,700
One more day and he'd break
the record.

813
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:31,640
The last record was 17 days.

814
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:34,710
Then Mr. Reporter, would you
like to try for the record?

815
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:40,580
Everyone move aside!
How can you block this area?

816
01:18:40,580 --> 01:18:42,180
That guy is really...

817
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:43,910
Why would we need to break 
the record?

818
01:18:45,250 --> 01:18:46,720
Who knows?

819
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:46,850
Who knows?

820
01:18:46,850 --> 01:18:48,720
=Keep watching up above.=

821
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:49,650
Okay.

822
01:18:49,650 --> 01:18:50,850
=If anything starts to come
through,=

823
01:18:50,850 --> 01:18:51,390
=just get away quickly.=

824
01:18:51,390 --> 01:18:51,790
=just get away quickly.=

825
01:18:51,790 --> 01:18:55,930
=It's only 0.6 meter around, 
so you don't have to move much.=

826
01:18:56,060 --> 01:18:58,200
Thank you. Then I'll see you
soon.

827
01:19:03,670 --> 01:19:06,740
It seems like it will come
through here.

828
01:19:10,210 --> 01:19:11,940
We'll be out soon.

829
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:20,350
<i>Higher, higher, higher!</i>

830
01:19:23,950 --> 01:19:28,360
This is a ventilation fan blade...
and this is asphalt.

831
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:30,360
Then we must be in the tunnel,
right?

832
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:31,430
That's right.

833
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:32,630
We've reached the bottom.

834
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:33,960
Don't speak too soon.

835
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:35,570
<i>But we found broken pieces of 
the ventilation fan.</i>

836
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:36,230
<i>Bring over the blueprints.</i>

837
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:37,170
Yes, here we go.

838
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:42,370
They're acting kind of strange.

839
01:19:42,910 --> 01:19:46,110
Look and see what's going on.

840
01:19:46,110 --> 01:19:50,110
Lee Jeong Su, did you...
see the drill come through?

841
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:52,920
I didn't see it.

842
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:54,120
Are the 2 ventilation fans still
intact?

843
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:55,450
Yes. Why?

844
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:01,860
After I confirm things, I'll 
call you back.

845
01:20:01,860 --> 01:20:03,060
Wait!

846
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:05,730
What is this?

847
01:20:05,730 --> 01:20:08,400
This film was taken when the 
tunnel was opened.

848
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:09,730
Watch.

849
01:20:12,670 --> 01:20:14,270
There are several fans showing.

850
01:20:14,270 --> 01:20:16,010
There should be 7.

851
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:19,880
One is missing.

852
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:21,480
How is that possible?

853
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:23,080
There are six. Six.

854
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:28,820
Damn it! This is worthless!
Worthless!

855
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:31,220
Check it again.

856
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:38,030
One. Two. Three. Four. 
Five. Six...

857
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:46,970
We thought there were 7, so we
thought No. 3 was right here.

858
01:20:47,770 --> 01:20:49,370
Actually, it's here.

859
01:20:50,170 --> 01:20:52,440
Then these blueprints are wrong?

860
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:59,650
Does that make any sense? 
It doesn't.

861
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:04,050
Captain, the fan installation
master said there should be 12.

862
01:21:04,050 --> 01:21:08,590
The team installed one for 
every two, in 6 places.

863
01:21:14,330 --> 01:21:15,670
It was the wrong place.

864
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:18,070
Really?

865
01:21:18,070 --> 01:21:19,000
Yes.

866
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:23,410
You mean they worked 17 days
for nothing?

867
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:44,760
<i>Isn't that Lee Jeong Su's wife?</i>

868
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:58,780
<i>So how far is it from 
Lee Jeong Su now? </i>

869
01:21:58,780 --> 01:21:59,840
<i>About 150 meters.</i>

870
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:01,580
He won't be able to move 
that far.

871
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:09,190
Then, we're going to have 
to drill again?

872
01:22:16,130 --> 01:22:17,460
When will you get through?

873
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,260
=I'm sorry.=

874
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,000
What?

875
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,200
=We drilled in the wrong place.=

876
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,010
What do you mean by that?

877
01:22:30,140 --> 01:22:36,410
We got the wrong location and
drilled in the wrong place.

878
01:22:41,490 --> 01:22:44,290
How can it be wrong?

879
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:47,620
=I'm really sorry.=

880
01:22:55,370 --> 01:22:59,100
If that's the case, then what 
should I do?

881
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:05,780
=First, we will restart the 
tunnel intersection project.=

882
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:07,780
And then?

883
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:11,920
=We'll start drilling all over 
again.=

884
01:23:12,180 --> 01:23:13,650
Starting over?

885
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:16,850
=We will go as fast as we can.=

886
01:23:52,090 --> 01:23:54,090
=Oppa, are you okay?=

887
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:59,830
Oppa. What's wrong?

888
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:06,100
I can't breathe.

889
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:10,110
Try to calm down and I'll find a 
doctor.

890
01:24:10,110 --> 01:24:13,180
I need some help here! He's
acting strange. Hurry!

891
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:16,910
No, no, no. My battery is going.

892
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:19,180
Se Hyeon, this is my last call.

893
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:21,850
Se Hyeon, my battery is dead.

894
01:24:22,250 --> 01:24:23,850
=Give the phone to Su Jin.=

895
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:25,590
=Give the phone to Su Jin.=

896
01:24:25,590 --> 01:24:27,190
Oppa, Su Jin isn't here.

897
01:24:27,190 --> 01:24:29,330
Oppa! Oppa, be strong.

898
01:24:29,330 --> 01:24:31,330
I can't stay here.

899
01:24:31,330 --> 01:24:32,930
I can't stay here.

900
01:24:32,930 --> 01:24:35,070
=Oppa!=
Se Hyeon, I can't hold on.

901
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:36,400
=You have to stay strong, Oppa!=

902
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:37,600
=Just hold on.=

903
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,740
Why do you keep telling me 
to be strong?

904
01:24:41,470 --> 01:24:43,470
I said I can't do it.

905
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:45,610
Honey. Hello? Hello?

906
01:24:45,610 --> 01:24:47,610
Tell me. Tell me, Oppa.

907
01:24:48,010 --> 01:24:55,490
Take good care of Su Jin and 
live your life well.

908
01:24:56,290 --> 01:24:58,560
What are you saying?

909
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:03,890
Se Hyeon, I'm sorry. 
I just can't go on.

910
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:05,900
I really can't go on.

911
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:22,050
Is that so? Then just do that.

912
01:25:23,510 --> 01:25:26,980
Just go ahead and die. Die!

913
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:32,860
But... if you die,

914
01:25:32,860 --> 01:25:35,790
Su Jin and I will die too!

915
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:40,060
Oppa, if you die then all of us
will die! Understand?

916
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:41,800
I'm not threatening you.

917
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:45,940
=Otherwise, just keep going.=

918
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:48,340
Don't talk about dying or 
things like that, okay?

919
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:50,210
You have to keep holding on.

920
01:25:50,610 --> 01:25:52,880
You have to live.

921
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:57,150
Please just live, okay? Please!

922
01:26:19,570 --> 01:26:24,110
What now? What now?

923
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:03,750
<i>Madam! Hey! Hurry, hurry!</i>

924
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:05,620
<i>Call an ambulance!</i>

925
01:27:22,030 --> 01:27:24,970
I'm asking why the snow 
blowers aren't here yet!

926
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:27,370
=Right now they're cleaning
roads in town.=

927
01:27:27,370 --> 01:27:28,970
We don't have any extra 
machines to send there.

928
01:27:28,970 --> 01:27:30,970
Shouldn't this place be top
priority?

929
01:27:30,970 --> 01:27:33,910
There have been more than 50 
car accidents in the past 2 days.

930
01:27:33,910 --> 01:27:35,650
There was a fatal accident 
yesterday.

931
01:27:36,450 --> 01:27:39,120
We're really too busy to die.

932
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:42,590
I know this isn't good to say,

933
01:27:43,650 --> 01:27:45,660
=but isn't it only one person?=

934
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:50,590
That person... that one person...
is still alive!

935
01:27:50,590 --> 01:27:52,730
Do you know how long he's
been waiting?

936
01:27:54,730 --> 01:27:58,070
Chief, I'm begging you.

937
01:27:58,870 --> 01:28:01,540
Please send us one snow-
blowing machine!

938
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:17,150
<i>Is Lee Jeong Su is still alive?</i>

939
01:28:17,690 --> 01:28:17,820
The miners in Chile were
rescued on the 69th day.
=23 days after collapse=

940
01:28:17,820 --> 01:28:21,290
The miners in Chile were
rescued on the 69th day.
=23 days after collapse=

941
01:28:21,290 --> 01:28:23,030
But that involved 33 people. 
=23 days after collapse=

942
01:28:23,030 --> 01:28:23,560
Additionally, their food supply 
was not a problem.

943
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:24,890
Additionally, their food supply
was not a problem.

944
01:28:24,890 --> 01:28:26,630
In a case like this without 
any food,

945
01:28:26,630 --> 01:28:29,430
the longest record of survival
is 19 days.

946
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:33,170
And with the extremely 
disturbing cold,

947
01:28:33,170 --> 01:28:36,370
on top of any injuries, it would 
be even more difficult, right?

948
01:28:36,370 --> 01:28:38,910
I can see that you're 
pessimistic, right?

949
01:28:38,910 --> 01:28:43,710
There are always variables, 
so we can't jump to conclusions.

950
01:28:43,710 --> 01:28:44,650
Yes.

951
01:28:44,650 --> 01:28:48,390
Today, is Lee Jeong Su's 23rd
day of isolation.

952
01:28:48,650 --> 01:28:51,590
Contact was lost one week ago.

953
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:56,390
During this time, we don't know
what might have happened to
Lee Jeong Su.

954
01:28:56,390 --> 01:28:59,730
We should not be too hasty 
in coming to conclusions,

955
01:28:59,730 --> 01:29:01,200
and consider carefully.

956
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:04,400
We are more willing to believe
in hope rather than statistics.

957
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:31,760
=This is a letter from 
Lee Jeong Su's wife.=

958
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:35,770
="Recently, Su Jin said living is
too hard."=

959
01:29:36,030 --> 01:29:39,100
="Why would Su Jin say such 
a thing at her age?"=

960
01:29:39,100 --> 01:29:41,910
="She doesn't like studying in 
kindergarten."=

961
01:29:41,910 --> 01:29:44,840
="Learning addition and 
subtraction is too hard?"=

962
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:47,380
="It seems she might be good 
at your major in liberal arts."=

963
01:29:47,910 --> 01:29:54,450
="Today she said her happiest 
time was when she was inside 
my tummy."=

964
01:29:54,450 --> 01:30:00,320
="I didn't know whether to laugh
or cry when she said she wanted
to get back inside..."=

965
01:30:02,190 --> 01:30:04,070
="...but she had gotten 
too big..."=

966
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:21,410
=Today, we're going to play a 
song that's not usual for our
station.=

967
01:30:21,810 --> 01:30:26,480
=Classical music fans may be 
surprised, but please forgive us.=

968
01:30:26,750 --> 01:30:29,020
=Lee Jeong Su, please listen.=

969
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:51,170
<i>From here on, the tunnel 
intersection rescue work,</i>

970
01:30:51,170 --> 01:30:52,510
<i>how is it progressing?</i>

971
01:30:52,510 --> 01:30:57,450
We are about 200 meters away
from Lee Jeong Su's location.

972
01:30:57,710 --> 01:31:02,250
If we go forward 15 meters 
a day, we will reach him in 
15 days.

973
01:31:02,250 --> 01:31:05,874
<i>After the failure of vertical drilling 
at nearly 9 days from the south...</i>

974
01:31:05,874 --> 01:31:07,860
Why did they call us here?

975
01:31:08,390 --> 01:31:09,860
What are they doing?

976
01:31:10,260 --> 01:31:13,460
The 2nd tunnel project has 
been stalled for nearly 25 days.

977
01:31:13,460 --> 01:31:15,870
Every day we're losing about 
$1.5 million.

978
01:31:15,870 --> 01:31:18,400
Our loss to date has exceeded 
$50 million.

979
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:21,870
Why are you unable to proceed
with the 2nd tunnel?

980
01:31:21,870 --> 01:31:24,083
We need to do blasting with
dynamite, so it's possible

981
01:31:24,083 --> 01:31:28,410
Lee Jeong Su's location would
be impacted.

982
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:32,820
Then, how much longer do we
have to wait?

983
01:31:33,220 --> 01:31:35,080
Honestly, I came here today

984
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:36,420
just to look you all in the eyes.

985
01:31:36,420 --> 01:31:37,490
Last time, because of a lizard,

986
01:31:37,490 --> 01:31:39,890
you must remember how the 
tunneling was interrupted.

987
01:31:39,890 --> 01:31:42,430
Do you know how much damage
was done to the national economy?

988
01:31:42,430 --> 01:31:45,230
Just because of some lizard?

989
01:31:45,230 --> 01:31:55,240
Hey. Excuse me, but Lee Jeong
Su is not a lizard. He's a person.

990
01:31:56,440 --> 01:32:02,450
Right now, trapped in that 
tunnel is not a reptile. It's a 
person. A person.

991
01:32:03,380 --> 01:32:07,520
I didn't mean anything by
what I said.

992
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:10,320
Yes. Although that's how it is,

993
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:12,860
I feel like you keep forgetting 
this fact.

994
01:32:13,260 --> 01:32:17,260
Right now, a person is trapped
in there. A person.

995
01:33:30,130 --> 01:33:32,540
Go rest! I'll do it.

996
01:33:38,810 --> 01:33:40,540
How must longer are we doing 
this?

997
01:33:40,810 --> 01:33:44,680
I know. What is all this just 
to dig out a corpse?

998
01:33:44,950 --> 01:33:48,420
Hey, how can you say 
something like that?

999
01:33:48,420 --> 01:33:51,220
Everyone keeps saying there's
no hope.

1000
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:53,760
They all think it but don't say it.

1001
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:57,090
Honestly, team leader, that's 
what you think too, isn't it?

1002
01:33:57,090 --> 01:34:02,300
No. Quit saying that kind of thing.

1003
01:34:03,630 --> 01:34:04,830
Go back to work.

1004
01:34:04,830 --> 01:34:06,300
Yes, yes.

1005
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:24,590
Team leader! Team leader!

1006
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:40,470
Minister, someone was just 
killed at the rescue site.

1007
01:34:43,540 --> 01:34:45,410
See? I knew that would happen.

1008
01:36:20,970 --> 01:36:24,440
Mom, she's wearing you out, 
right? I'm sorry.

1009
01:36:24,440 --> 01:36:28,040
=Just worry about taking care
of yourself.=

1010
01:36:28,040 --> 01:36:29,650
=Have you eaten?=

1011
01:36:29,650 --> 01:36:31,650
I can still eat.

1012
01:36:31,650 --> 01:36:33,650
Did Su Jin stay home from
school?

1013
01:36:34,180 --> 01:36:35,520
=Yes.=

1014
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:38,190
Why?

1015
01:36:40,060 --> 01:36:42,060
=Well...=

1016
01:36:42,460 --> 01:36:43,790
What?

1017
01:36:44,460 --> 01:36:49,530
The children heard what their
mothers have said,

1018
01:36:49,530 --> 01:36:52,070
and said something to Su Jin.

1019
01:36:52,870 --> 01:36:54,600
What did they say?

1020
01:36:55,540 --> 01:36:59,940
=That because of Su Jin's father,
other people were suffering.=

1021
01:37:01,540 --> 01:37:03,550
=I was really speechless.=

1022
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:06,350
=So I could only say one 
word to them.=

1023
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:10,090
=Mom, keep Su Jin home from
school,=

1024
01:37:10,090 --> 01:37:11,290
=until I come back.=

1025
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:26,900
Because of you, my son has
passed away.

1026
01:37:27,570 --> 01:37:30,910
Because of you, my son is dead!

1027
01:37:31,710 --> 01:37:33,980
Just to look for your husband's
corpse,

1028
01:37:33,980 --> 01:37:37,050
my healthy son has died!

1029
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:46,260
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1030
01:38:12,950 --> 01:38:15,220
-=Resumption of 2nd Hado 
Tunnel project approved 
by 65%.=-

1031
01:38:23,230 --> 01:38:25,230
-=Consent to restart 2nd Hado 
Tunnel project=-

1032
01:38:25,230 --> 01:38:29,100
<i>We understand it's very 
difficult.</i>

1033
01:38:31,630 --> 01:38:33,900
But the longer this drags on,

1034
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:36,440
our situation also becomes
more difficult.

1035
01:38:37,110 --> 01:38:39,510
The country also feels it's 
time to stop.

1036
01:38:39,510 --> 01:38:41,510
More than 65% do.

1037
01:38:43,510 --> 01:38:45,380
Everyone is exhausted.

1038
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:49,250
If you keep insisting they 
continue,

1039
01:38:49,790 --> 01:38:53,520
and someone else gets hurt, 
what will you do then?

1040
01:38:58,330 --> 01:39:01,130
It's time that you face reality.

1041
01:39:02,060 --> 01:39:03,670
But...

1042
01:39:04,870 --> 01:39:06,870
Please go ahead.

1043
01:39:15,410 --> 01:39:20,080
If my husband is still alive, 
then what?

1044
01:39:25,690 --> 01:39:27,420
Wouldn't you feel sorry to him?

1045
01:39:51,450 --> 01:39:55,720
Stop work!

1046
01:40:43,230 --> 01:40:47,500
=Oppa. Oppa, are you 
listening?=

1047
01:40:50,170 --> 01:40:51,910
=It's Se Hyeon.=

1048
01:41:00,580 --> 01:41:03,390
=I don't know if you can still
hear me or not.=

1049
01:41:10,330 --> 01:41:12,460
=It must be very cold.=

1050
01:41:25,010 --> 01:41:27,140
You must be hungry.

1051
01:41:36,620 --> 01:41:39,160
I went to sign papers today.

1052
01:41:40,490 --> 01:41:44,890
There's a second tunnel nearby.

1053
01:41:46,230 --> 01:41:49,570
I signed the consent for them
to start work again.

1054
01:41:54,900 --> 01:42:01,310
They're going to stop...
trying to save you.

1055
01:42:09,050 --> 01:42:11,050
=Everyone has to leave now.=

1056
01:42:11,850 --> 01:42:14,520
=The rescue effort is over.=

1057
01:42:16,130 --> 01:42:17,730
=Stop waiting.=

1058
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:22,400
=Nobody will be coming.=

1059
01:42:23,730 --> 01:42:25,870
=I know I shouldn't say that.=

1060
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:27,600
=I'm sorry.=

1061
01:42:27,870 --> 01:42:30,140
=It's a terrible thing to have
to say.=

1062
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:43,890
Maybe... Maybe you're not 
still waiting.

1063
01:42:45,620 --> 01:42:49,630
I was afraid you might keep
waiting for us and not leave.

1064
01:42:54,160 --> 01:42:56,170
I'm sorry, Oppa.

1065
01:43:03,110 --> 01:43:05,640
=But are you still alive?=

1066
01:43:08,980 --> 01:43:13,780
The people here have said you
couldn't still be in this world.

1067
01:43:15,120 --> 01:43:17,520
They say that you're dead.

1068
01:43:22,460 --> 01:43:24,190
=I'm sorry, Oppa.=

1069
01:43:34,070 --> 01:43:37,010
But if you're listening to me 
right now, what will we do?

1070
01:43:37,540 --> 01:43:41,680
Oppa, I'm really sorry. 
I'm sorry, Oppa.

1071
01:43:43,010 --> 01:43:47,020
Oppa. Jeong Su oppa.
I'm sorry.

1072
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:49,420
What should I do?

1073
01:43:50,750 --> 01:43:52,350
They can't.

1074
01:44:05,170 --> 01:44:09,570
I'm still alive.

1075
01:44:11,710 --> 01:44:13,980
I'm alive.

1076
01:45:51,010 --> 01:45:53,650
<i>After an interruption of 27 days
due to rescue efforts for Lee 
Jeong Su,</i>

1077
01:45:53,650 --> 01:45:54,340
<i>After an interruption of 27 days
due to rescue efforts for Lee
Jeong Su,</i>

1078
01:45:54,340 --> 01:45:56,210
<i>the second Hado Tunnel project</i>

1079
01:45:56,210 --> 01:45:58,080
<i>will be restarting today.</i>

1080
01:45:58,080 --> 01:46:02,220
<i>After completion of the 2nd 
tunnel, the drive from Hado to 
Seoul</i>

1081
01:46:02,220 --> 01:46:03,950
<i>will be less than 40 minutes.</i>

1082
01:46:03,950 --> 01:46:07,290
Captain, if you take this upon 
yourself, I'll get fired.

1083
01:46:07,290 --> 01:46:11,160
The channel has been in there 
too long.

1084
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:13,960
It might be bent or even have
a crack.

1085
01:46:14,500 --> 01:46:17,830
This is very dangerous, Captain.
You don't have to do this.

1086
01:46:17,830 --> 01:46:21,170
I told him to wait.

1087
01:46:21,700 --> 01:46:25,040
I would be despicable if I
just walked away now.

1088
01:46:27,180 --> 01:46:30,510
Whether he's alive or dead, 
I have to be sure.

1089
01:46:32,510 --> 01:46:33,850
Send me down.

1090
01:46:37,450 --> 01:46:39,190
Stay in contact with us.

1091
01:46:39,190 --> 01:46:41,190
If anything goes wrong, I'm 
pulling you up immediately.

1092
01:46:41,190 --> 01:46:42,390
Okay.

1093
01:47:10,950 --> 01:47:12,690
=You'll be there soon.=

1094
01:47:12,690 --> 01:47:14,560
=There may be some vibrations.=

1095
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:15,890
=Hold on tightly.=

1096
01:47:15,890 --> 01:47:17,490
You could have told me sooner.

1097
01:49:05,730 --> 01:49:08,670
Drilling leader! Who is it?
Did they go down?

1098
01:49:08,670 --> 01:49:11,610
He wanted to make a
final confirmation.

1099
01:49:11,610 --> 01:49:12,940
Pull him back up right now!

1100
01:49:12,940 --> 01:49:14,680
They're about to start blasting!

1101
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:29,490
=Captain. Captain?=

1102
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:36,160
Drilling leader, don't talk to me.
It's too noisy.

1103
01:49:36,970 --> 01:49:39,770
=I'm sorry, but you have to
come up right now.=

1104
01:49:39,770 --> 01:49:41,770
Wait! Just give me 5 minutes!

1105
01:49:41,770 --> 01:49:44,570
=Close the door. I'm pulling 
you up right now.=

1106
01:49:45,510 --> 01:49:54,720
Lee Jeong Su! Lee Jeong Su! 
Lee Jeong Su!

1107
01:49:58,190 --> 01:49:59,660
<i>Is it all clear now?</i>

1108
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:13,660
Do you know how expensive
this is?

1109
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:15,520
There are only a few of these
in the country!

1110
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:20,600
That's enough already!

1111
01:52:21,400 --> 01:52:24,730
You should just care more 
about the equipment.

1112
01:52:30,740 --> 01:52:31,810
Wait!

1113
01:52:31,810 --> 01:52:32,870
Why?

1114
01:52:35,940 --> 01:52:37,810
Stop! Stop working!

1115
01:52:37,810 --> 01:52:38,880
Nobody move!

1116
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:43,690
Don't you move! Don't move!
Don't move! Stop!

1117
01:52:55,960 --> 01:52:56,900
There's movement!

1118
01:53:39,880 --> 01:53:42,010
Demolition team! Demolition team!

1119
01:53:42,010 --> 01:53:45,480
Stop blasting! Stop blasting!

1120
01:53:46,010 --> 01:53:48,280
Lee Jeong Su is still alive!

1121
01:53:49,350 --> 01:53:52,420
Lee Jeong Su is still alive!
Stop blasting!

1122
01:53:52,820 --> 01:53:54,820
<i>Lee Jeong Su is still alive!</i>

1123
01:54:54,120 --> 01:54:58,120
-=35 days after collapse=-

1124
01:55:31,990 --> 01:55:34,390
Captain, over there.

1125
01:56:20,700 --> 01:56:21,770
<i>He's coming out!</i>

1126
01:56:26,570 --> 01:56:28,980
<i>Lee Jeong Su, how are you
feeling? </i>

1127
01:56:36,450 --> 01:56:39,650
<i>Please clear the way!</i>

1128
01:56:55,270 --> 01:56:57,010
I'm sorry!

1129
01:57:03,010 --> 01:57:05,010
Please move aside!

1130
01:57:15,960 --> 01:57:17,690
Clear the way! Move aside!

1131
01:57:36,240 --> 01:57:38,110
Hey. Why aren't we going?

1132
01:57:38,110 --> 01:57:39,450
They want us to wait a moment.

1133
01:57:39,450 --> 01:57:40,780
Who said that? Why?

1134
01:57:40,780 --> 01:57:43,720
Just a moment. 
The Minister is coming.

1135
01:57:43,990 --> 01:57:45,190
Wait a moment longer
before you go.

1136
01:57:45,190 --> 01:57:46,520
Wait a moment longer
before you go.

1137
01:57:46,520 --> 01:57:47,990
Are you out of your mind?

1138
01:57:48,260 --> 01:57:50,130
Take it up with the Department.

1139
01:57:51,460 --> 01:57:53,060
She's here right now.

1140
01:57:55,200 --> 01:57:57,470
<i>Minister, please say something!</i>

1141
01:58:06,270 --> 01:58:10,680
Wait! It looks like Lee Jeong 
Su is saying something!

1142
01:58:10,680 --> 01:58:12,410
What are his first words after 
coming back into the world?

1143
01:58:12,410 --> 01:58:13,880
What did he say?

1144
01:58:13,880 --> 01:58:15,620
Please tell us what he said!

1145
01:58:17,490 --> 01:58:20,560
<i>We can't hear you! 
Say it louder!</i>

1146
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:22,820
Okay.

1147
01:58:26,430 --> 01:58:29,360
"Tell those sons of bitches
to get lost!"

1148
01:58:36,970 --> 01:58:39,640
That's what he said.

1149
01:58:44,180 --> 01:58:46,180
Okay. Take him away.

1150
01:58:48,180 --> 01:58:50,190
Lift. 1. 2. 3.

1151
01:58:57,390 --> 01:59:01,400
Who did he mean? Me? Why?

1152
01:59:41,970 --> 01:59:45,970
After being buried for 35 days, 
Lee Jeong Su has come back
safely.

1153
01:59:45,970 --> 01:59:47,710
For a person buried alone,

1154
01:59:47,710 --> 01:59:50,210
this has special significance as
the world's record.

1155
01:59:50,210 --> 01:59:55,160
But before we rejoice, there 
were some big problems with 
the rescue efforts.

1156
01:59:55,160 --> 01:59:55,320
But before we rejoice, there
were some big problems with
the rescue efforts.

1157
01:59:55,320 --> 01:59:55,580
He gave a thumbs up to thank
the government for their efforts.

1158
01:59:55,580 --> 01:59:59,990
He gave a thumbs up to thank
the government for their efforts.

1159
01:59:59,990 --> 02:00:03,150
Once again, we are all grateful 
to the government and the 
nation for the rescue efforts.

1160
02:00:03,150 --> 02:00:03,460
Once again, we are all grateful
to the government and the
nation for the rescue efforts.

1161
02:00:03,460 --> 02:00:06,390
The events of today have 
reminded me that there is
nothing in this whole world

1162
02:00:06,390 --> 02:00:07,790
The events of today have
reminded me that there is
nothing in this whole world

1163
02:00:07,790 --> 02:00:08,260
The events of today have
reminded me that there is
nothing in this whole world

1164
02:00:08,260 --> 02:00:08,930
The events of today have
reminded me that there is
nothing in this whole world

1165
02:00:08,930 --> 02:00:12,200
more important than even 
one person's life.

1166
02:00:12,200 --> 02:00:14,140
more important than even
one person's life.

1167
02:00:19,070 --> 02:00:22,010
<i>How can you park your car here?</i>

1168
02:00:22,810 --> 02:00:27,620
I should not have used profanity,

1169
02:00:28,950 --> 02:00:34,820
as it undermines the reputation
of civil servants.

1170
02:00:35,220 --> 02:00:38,430
Why should I have to write this?

1171
02:00:38,430 --> 02:00:42,960
They asked me what he said
and I just told them.

1172
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:45,370
So why should I have to write
a letter of apology?

1173
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:49,770
They all deserved it anyway.

1174
02:00:54,180 --> 02:00:55,780
Shostakovich.

1175
02:00:55,780 --> 02:00:57,910
=We were just listening to 
Shostakovich.=

1176
02:00:57,910 --> 02:00:59,650
=Violin Concerto No. 1.=

1177
02:01:02,180 --> 02:01:04,990
If I had stayed any longer, 
I could have written a symphony.

1178
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:08,720
=He's finally going home after
a long time.=

1179
02:01:08,720 --> 02:01:13,660
=We hope he can finally eat and
make up for everything he 
missed.=

1180
02:01:13,930 --> 02:01:16,330
=Su Jin, you must go to bed
early tonight.=

1181
02:01:16,330 --> 02:01:18,330
=Lee Jeong Su, to help your 
strength today,=

1182
02:01:18,330 --> 02:01:19,930
=we will play an energizing
song for you.=

1183
02:01:19,930 --> 02:01:21,400
This guy is too funny.

1184
02:01:21,400 --> 02:01:24,340
Wouldn't he get fired for 
saying things like that?

1185
02:01:25,140 --> 02:01:28,480
My mother made braised pork 
ribs. Does that sound good?

1186
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:30,610
Really good.

1187
02:01:31,950 --> 02:01:35,420
=Tunnel ahead. Please drive
safely.=
