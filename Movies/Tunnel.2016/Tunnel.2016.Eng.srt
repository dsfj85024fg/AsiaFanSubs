547
01:16:16,101 --> 01:16:17,471
You've already had how many?

548
01:16:18,067 --> 01:16:20,240
He spoke it with you

549
01:16:23,034 --> 01:16:31,180
Paper cups, not this.
Almost equal to the size of the glass.

550
01:16:32,234 --> 01:16:35,181
Want to drink?
/ Please

551
01:16:38,134 --> 01:16:41,274
<I> As already known,
Lee Jung Soo trapped inside </ i>

01:16:41,301 --> 01:16:45,147
<I> the tunnel, just our station

Lee Jong Su, will leave

558
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,072

I'll leave

561
01:18:17,967 --> 01:18:19,913
Very tired

562
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:29,211
Too bad. If faster
one day be able to break record

563
01:18:29,967 --> 01:18:31,969
At that time 17 days

564
01:18:32,067 --> 01:18:35,173
You broke the record alone

565
01:18:38,001 --> 01:18:40,174
Do not block the road

566
01:18:40,967 --> 01:18:44,915
Can not break the world record.

567
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,078
Do not know

568
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:50,013
<I> Take a look at the top </ i>

569
01:18:50,034 --> 01:18:56,110
<I> that something was falling, fast
dodge, the movement must be fast </ i>

573
01:19:24,134 --> 01:19:28,082

01:19:28,867 --> 01:19:30,107
Reached down there, right?

575
01:19:30,867 --> 01:19:32,972
Yes. Reached down there

579
01:19:46,067 --> 01:19:50,846
You see something?

01:19:52,001 --> 01:19:52,945

I'm just making sure,
I'll call again

583
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:10,007
What is this?
/ Not so long to get this image

584
01:20:13,034 --> 01:20:14,843
How many sections?

585
01:20:14,867 --> 01:20:16,039

586
01:20:18,534 --> 01:20:20,673

587
01:20:21,534 --> 01:20:22,672

592
01:20:49,767 --> 01:20:52,646

593
01:20:55,467 --> 01:20:56,537
What is reasonable?

594
01:20:57,700 --> 01:20:59,646
What is reasonable?

595
01:20:59,667 --> 01:21:03,638
Not this section

596
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:08,672
No 2 in a 6 masing2.

597
01:21:14,534 --> 01:21:15,738
It seems wrong to dig

598
01:21:17,467 --> 01:21:18,468
Really?
/ Yes

599
01:21:19,667 --> 01:21:23,581
So all of this sia2 for 17 days?

600
01:21:56,567 --> 01:21:58,513
How far did he fall?

601
01:21:58,534 --> 01:22:01,481
150 meters
/ That can not be

602
01:22:06,634 --> 01:22:09,410
Digging from the start

What do you mean?

606
01:22:30,401 --> 01:22:36,579
We were wrong location

607
01:22:41,434 --> 01:22:43,607
How can another location?

608
01:22:45,567 --> 01:22:47,376
<I> Sorry once </ i>

609
01:22:55,467 --> 01:22:59,347
Then, how?

610
01:22:59,534 --> 01:23:05,485
<I> We're going to start to open a new road </ i>

611
01:23:06,334 --> 01:23:07,369
Then?

612
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:11,471
<I> We have to start again </ i>

613
01:23:12,334 --> 01:23:13,438
From the beginning?

614
01:23:14,601 --> 01:23:16,444
<I> We'll do the fastest </ i>

615
01:23:51,567 --> 01:23:55,447
<I> You good right? </ I>

616
01:23:57,501 --> 01:23:59,412
Why, oppa?

617

I can not stand anymore

618
01:24:06,401 --> 01:24:09,439
Oppa, hold briefly. I would
let you talk to the chief

619
01:24:09,534 --> 01:24:13,277
Help me, oppa odd start

This is the last, I have no
battery ... give Soo jin

622
01:24:25,467 --> 01:24:28,505
Oppa, no Soo jin. Oppa, realize

623
01:24:29,234 --> 01:24:32,374
I can not stand it anymore

624
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,380
oppa
/ I can not stand anymore

625
01:24:34,434 --> 01:24:37,278
Oppa, realized. You must survive

626
01:24:37,401 --> 01:24:39,472
Why continue to make me survive ?!

627
01:24:41,367 --> 01:24:44,507
I can not stand ... hello ...

628
01:24:45,267 --> 01:24:46,507
Hello

629
01:24:47,367 --> 01:24:49,278
<I> You ... </ i>

01:24:49,301 --> 01:24:55,252
You keep Soo Jin good
and watch yourself good

631
01:24:56,234 --> 01:24:58,305
Oppa ... you're talking about?

632
01:24:59,334 --> 01:25:05,410
Sorry ... I could not stand anymore

633
01:25:18,234 --> 01:25:21,374
Well ... do

634
01:25:23,267 --> 01:25:26,441
Just die...

635
01:25:28,334 --> 01:25:29,369
But

636
01:25:31,367 --> 01:25:35,315
If you die, I and
Soo Jin will die

637
01:25:35,467 --> 01:25:41,383
If you die, we
all will die, understand?

638
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:48,182
Please hang on. Do not give up.

639
01:25:48,234 --> 01:25:52,410
You need to stay afloat, just
in a way that can only survive

640
01:25:53,301 --> 01:25:57,272
I beg you, you should
survive, I beg you.

641
01:26:21,167 --> 01:26:23,147
How...

642
01:26:58,367 --> 01:27:05,148
Fast ...

643
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:24,307
Why still not arrived?

644
01:27:24,367 --> 01:27:28,247
Now traffic jam
worse, it took arriving there

645
01:27:28,300 --> 01:27:30,246
Anyway quickly arrived!

646
01:27:30,334 --> 01:27:33,044
During these 2 days
50 accidents have occurred

647
01:27:33,134 --> 01:27:35,239
traffic, even yesterday
No deaths occurred.

648
01:27:36,267 --> 01:27:39,146
We tasted going to die

649
01:27:39,301 --> 01:27:45,183
I do not want to talk like this,
but it's just one lives

650
01:27:45,234 --> 01:27:52,243
That man, one life was still alive

651
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:58,080
I hope

652
01:27:58,301 --> 01:28:01,282
I beg you

653
01:28:15,034 --> 01:28:17,014
What Lee Jong Soo is still alive?

654
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:20,239
69 days to save them

655
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:24,140
at that time there were 33 people,
and food sufficient

656
01:28:24,234 --> 01:28:29,183
This incident no food,
the longest 19 days survival

657
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:35,973
coupled with the weather
cool, will be more difficult

658
01:28:36,067 --> 01:28:38,104
I know the same situation
no support ..

659
01:28:44,234 --> 01:28:48,114
It is a day to 23

660
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,243
From now on, we can not know
what happened to Lee Jong Soo

661
01:29:00,267 --> 01:29:04,113
We still have to keep believing

662
01:29:27,067 --> 01:29:31,106
<I> This letter from the wife of Lee Jung Soo </ i>

663
01:29:32,001 --> 01:29:35,073
<I> Siu Chen often end
talk ... tired </ i>

664
01:29:35,167 --> 01:29:38,080
<I> Siu Chen age of 8 years, why
can talk like that? </ i>

665
01:29:38,967 --> 01:29:44,110
<I> He does not like kindergarten, very difficult. </ I>

666
01:29:44,167 --> 01:29:47,046
<I> He seems like you </ i>

667
01:29:47,134 --> 01:29:53,915
<I> Today she says, happy
once in the stomach of the mother </ i>

668
01:29:54,034 --> 01:30:00,041
<I> I told you, you would
back into my stomach </ i>

669
01:30:01,934 --> 01:30:05,371
<I> He says he wants it so, only
already grown up, can not come back again. </ i>

670
01:30:26,534 --> 01:30:28,480
<I> Lee Jong Soo, do you hear me? </ I>

671
01:30:47,501 --> 01:30:57,354
What is progress?

672
01:30:57,434 --> 01:31:01,473
Every day forward slightly, 15
days could reach that location

673
01:31:10,301 --> 01:31:13,339
The tunnel project is already
stop for 25 days

674
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:17,507
and have spent a lot of costs

675
01:31:18,267 --> 01:31:21,441
Whether the project can not proceed?

676
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:28,281
Using explosives, probably
it is dangerous for Lee Jung Soo

677
01:31:30,234 --> 01:31:32,475
We have to wait until when?

678
01:31:33,301 --> 01:31:35,508
Frankly, I'm here,
view others

679
01:31:36,267 --> 01:31:39,407
When it was just a mistake
small, the project was forced to stop

680
01:31:39,467 --> 01:31:42,346
Huge losses to the state

681
01:31:42,367 --> 01:31:46,213
Just because this little thing
/ It ..

682
01:31:47,467 --> 01:31:54,442
Lee Jung Soo and not "things" but human.

683
01:31:56,334 --> 01:32:01,283
Now trapped inside
the tunnel is not the object but human.

684
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:07,248
I did not mean it

685
01:32:07,301 --> 01:32:12,375
Yes, even so, I guess
You always forget the fact that

686
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:17,214
Now someone trapped in there

687
01:33:29,367 --> 01:33:32,348
Let me ...

688
01:33:38,234 --> 01:33:40,145
Until when do we have to do this?

689
01:33:40,301 --> 01:33:43,373
True, what we continue to do this?

690
01:33:44,367 --> 01:33:48,110
Why do you say that?

691
01:33:48,167 --> 01:33:51,148
All hopeless

692
01:33:51,167 --> 01:33:55,343
All just could not speak out,
do not you think so too?

693
01:33:56,101 --> 01:33:58,172
No?
/ No

694
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:02,213
Do not speak so

695
01:34:03,267 --> 01:34:06,146
Continue
/ Yes

696
01:34:21,167 --> 01:34:24,148
Chairman

697
01:34:43,067 --> 01:34:45,172
See, I knew it would be like this

698
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:23,204
Mother, you must be tired, right? Sorry

699
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:29,006
<I> Think of yourself

700
01:36:29,100 --> 01:36:33,048
Yes, I've eaten.
Soo Jin did not go?

701
01:36:36,134 --> 01:36:37,169
Why?

702
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:43,046
<I> It was ... </ i>
/ Why?

703
01:36:44,034 --> 01:36:48,915
<I> Child hear word of her </ i>

704
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,139
<I> What happens to Soo Jin? </ I>

705
01:36:52,901 --> 01:36:53,971
What?

706
01:36:55,067 --> 01:36:59,106
<I> Because father Soo Jin, everyone hard </ i>

707
01:37:01,067 --> 01:37:05,880
<I> I can not talk,
so he's talking </ i>

708
01:37:07,134 --> 01:37:11,048
Mom please take care Soo
Jin until I return

709
01:37:23,934 --> 01:37:25,914
Because of you, my son die

710
01:37:27,100 --> 01:37:30,047
Because of you, my son die

711
01:37:31,067 --> 01:37:36,016
Looking for your husband's body,
healthy children have died

712
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,070
Sorry

713
01:37:44,067 --> 01:37:45,876
Sorry

714
01:38:24,901 --> 01:38:28,849
You have to understand

715
01:38:30,900 --> 01:38:35,974
time is long, we
had done everything

716
01:38:36,034 --> 01:38:40,847
Let us stop this

717
01:38:43,567 --> 01:38:45,638
All were tired

718
01:38:46,767 --> 01:38:53,616
If you still insist,
what if there are more victims?

719
01:38:58,567 --> 01:39:01,514
Time for us to surrender

720
01:39:01,667 --> 01:39:03,510
No

721
01:39:04,667 --> 01:39:06,544
say

722
01:39:15,534 --> 01:39:19,607
What if my husband was alive?

723
01:39:25,667 --> 01:39:27,613
Do not you feel guilty?

724
01:39:50,667 --> 01:39:55,514
